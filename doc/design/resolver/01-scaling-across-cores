01-scaling-across-cores

Introduction
------------
The general issue is how to insure that the resolver scales.

Currently resolvers are CPU bound, and it seems likely that both
instructions-per-cycle and CPU frequency will not increase radically,
scaling will need to be across multiple cores.

How can we best scale a recursive resolver across multiple cores?

Some possible solutions:

a. Multiple processes with independent caches
b. Multiple processes with shared cache
c. A mix of independent/shared cache
d. Thread variations of the above

All of these may be complicated by NUMA architectures (with
faster/slower access to specific RAM).

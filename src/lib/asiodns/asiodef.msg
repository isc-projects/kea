FETCHCOMP   upstream fetch to %1(%2) has now completed
+ A debug message, this records the the upstream fetch (a query made by the
+ resolver on behalf of its client) to the specified address has completed.

FETCHSTOP   upstream fetch to %1(%2) has been stopped
+ An external component has requested the halting of an upstream fetch.  This
+ is an allowed operation, and the message should only appear if debug is
+ enabled.

OPENSOCK    error %1 opening %2 socket to %3(%4)
+ The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying to open a socket
+ of the specified protocol in order to send a message to the target address.
+ The the number of the system error that cause the problem is given in the
+ message.

RECVSOCK    error %1 reading %2 data from %3(%4)
+ The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying read data from
+ the specified address on the given protocol.  The the number of the system
+ error that cause the problem is given in the message.

SENDSOCK    error %1 sending data using %2 to %3(%4)
+ The asynchronous I/O code encountered an error when trying send data to
+ the specified address on the given protocol.  The the number of the system
+ error that cause the problem is given in the message.

RECVTMO     receive timeout while waiting for data from %1(%2)
+ An upstream fetch from the specified address timed out.  This may happen for
+ any number of reasons and is most probably a problem at the remote server
+ or a problem on the network.  The message will only appear if debug is
+ enabled.

UNKORIGIN  unknown origin for ASIO error code %1 (protocol: %2, address %3)
+ This message should not appear and indicates an internal error if it does.
+ Please enter a bug report.

UNKRESULT  unknown result (%1) when IOFetch::stop() was executed for I/O to %2(%3)
+ The termination method of the resolver's upstream fetch class was called with
+ an unknown result code (which is given in the message).  This message should
+ not appear and may indicate an internal error.  Please enter a bug report.

== TODO for MsgQ

* The code could use some refactoring.

* Refactor:  Right now, the MsgQ class manages each connection using several
lists.  There should be a Client class which holds most of this per-client
data.  Some will need to remain in the main "driver" MsgQ class (such as the
list of clients and their lnames) but buffer management, reading from a
socket, etc. could all go into this client class.

* More tests:  A test to send to strange locations should be added, to test
that code path (a bug which I am committing with this file...)

/// DProcessBase interface.  It runs the process like a stand-alone, command
/// line driven executable, which must be supplied a configuration file at
/// startup. It coordinates command line argument parsing, process
/// instantiation and initialization, and runtime control through external
/// command and configuration event handling.
/// It creates the IOService instance which is used for runtime control
/// events and passes the IOService into the application process at process
/// creation.
/// It provides the callback handlers for command and configuration events
/// which could be triggered by an external source.  Such sources are intended
/// to be registered with and monitored by the controller's IOService such that
/// the appropriate handler can be invoked.
///
/// DControllerBase provides dynamic configuration file reloading upon receipt
/// of SIGHUP, and graceful shutdown upon receipt of either SIGINT or SIGTERM.
///
/// NOTE: Derivations must supply their own static singleton instance method(s)
/// for creating and fetching the instance. The base class declares the instance

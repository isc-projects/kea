/// \brief The \c Message class encapsulates a standard DNS message.
///
/// Details of the design and interfaces of this class are still in flux.
/// Here are some notes about the current design.
///
/// Since many realistic DNS applications deal with messages, message objects
/// will be frequently used, and can be performance sensitive.  To minimize
/// the performance overhead of constructing and destructing the objects,
/// this class is designed to be reusable.  The \c clear() method is provided
/// for this purpose.
///
/// A \c Message class object is in either the \c PARSE or the \c RENDER mode.
/// A \c PARSE mode object is intended to be used to convert wire-format
/// message data into a complete \c Message object.
/// A \c RENDER mode object is intended to be used to convert a \c Message
/// object into wire-format data.
/// Some of the method functions of this class are limited to a specific mode.
/// In general, "set" type operations are only allowed for \c RENDER mode
/// objects.
/// The initial mode must be specified on construction, and can be changed
/// through some method functions.
///
/// This class uses the "pimpl" idiom, and hides detailed implementation
/// through the \c impl_ pointer.  Since a \c Message object is expected to
/// be reused, the construction overhead of this approach should be acceptable.
///
/// Open issues (among other things):
/// - We may want to provide an "iterator" for all RRsets/RRs for convenience.
///   This will be for applications that do not care about performance much,
///   so the implementation can only be moderately efficient.
/// - may want to provide a "find" method for a specified type
///   of RR in the message.
class Message {

        PARSE = 0,              ///< Parse mode (handling an incoming message)
        RENDER = 1              ///< Render mode (building an outgoing message)
    };

    /// \brief Constants for flag bit fields of a DNS message header.
    ///
    /// Only the defined constants are valid where a header flag is required
    /// in this library (e.g., in \c Message::setHeaderFlag()).
    /// Since these are enum constants, however, invalid value could be passed
    /// via casting without an error at compilation time.
    /// It is generally the callee's responsibility to check and reject invalid
    /// values.
    /// Of course, applications shouldn't pass invalid values even if the
    /// callee does not perform proper validation; the result in such usage
    /// is undefined.
    ///
    /// In the current implementation, the defined values happen to be
    /// a 16-bit integer with one bit being set corresponding to the
    /// specified flag in the second 16 bits of the DNS Header section
    /// in order to make the internal implementation simpler.
    /// For example, \c HEADERFLAG_QR is defined to be 0x8000 as the QR
    /// bit is the most significant bit of the 2nd 16 bits of the header.
    /// However, applications should not assume this coincidence and
    /// must solely use the enum representations.
    /// Any usage based on the assumption of the underlying values is invalid
    /// and the result is undefined.
    ///
    /// Likewise, bit wise operations such as AND or OR on the flag values
    /// are invalid and are not guaranteed to work, even if it could compile
    /// with casting.
    /// For example, the following code will compile:
    /// \code const uint16_t combined_flags =
    ///           static_cast<uint16_t>(Message::HEADERFLAG_AA) |
    ///           static_cast<uint16_t>(Message::HEADERFLAG_CD);
    /// message->setHeaderFlag(static_cast<Message::HeaderFlag>(combined_flags));

    /// validly written as follows:
    /// \code message->setHeaderFlag(Message::HEADERFLAG_AA);
    /// message->setHeaderFlag(Message::HEADERFLAG_CD);
    /// \endcode
    /// But the former notation is invalid and may not work in future versions.
    /// We did not try to prohibit such usage at compilation time, e.g., by
    /// introducing a separately defined class considering the balance
    /// between the complexity and advantage, but hopefully the cast notation
    /// is sufficiently ugly to prevent proliferation of the usage.

    /// <b>Open Design Issue:</b>
    /// In the current implementation the values for the constants are
    /// sorted in the order of appearance in DNS messages, i.e.,
    /// from %Question to Additional.
    /// So, for example,
    /// code <code>section >= Message::SECTION_AUTHORITY</code> can be
    /// used to do something in or after the Authority section.
    /// This would be convenient, but it is not clear if it's really a good
    /// idea to rely on relationship between the underlying values of enum
    /// constants.  At the moment, applications are discouraged to rely on
    /// this implementation detail.  We will see if such usage is sufficiently
    /// common to officially support it.

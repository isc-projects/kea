    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      BIND is the popular implementation of a DNS server, developer
      interfaces, and DNS tools.
      BIND 10 is a rewrite of BIND 9 and ISC DHCP.
      BIND 10 is written in C++ and Python and provides a modular
      environment for serving, maintaining, and developing DNS and DHCP.
      BIND 10 provides a EDNS0- and DNSSEC-capable authoritative
      DNS server and a caching recursive name server which also
      provides forwarding.
      It also provides experimental DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers.
    </para>

    <para>
      This guide covers BIND 10 version &__VERSION__;.

    <section>
      <title>Supported Platforms</title>
      <para>
  BIND 10 builds have been tested on (in no particular order)
  Debian GNU/Linux 6 and unstable, Ubuntu 9.10, NetBSD 5,
  Solaris 10 and 11, FreeBSD 7 and 8, CentOS Linux 5.3,
  MacOS 10.6 and 10.7, and OpenBSD 5.1.

  It has been tested on Sparc, i386, and amd64 hardware
  platforms.

        It is planned for BIND 10 to build, install and run on
        Windows and standard Unix-type platforms.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="required-software">
      <title>Required Software at Run-time</title>

      <para>
        Running BIND 10 uses various extra software which may
        not be provided in some operating systems' default
        installations nor standard packages collections. You may
        need to install this required software separately.
        (For the build requirements, also see
        <xref linkend="build-requirements"/>.)
      </para>

      <para>
        BIND 10 requires at least Python 3.1
        (<ulink url="http://www.python.org/"/>).
        It also works with Python 3.2.
      </para>

      <para>
        BIND 10 uses the Botan crypto library for C++
        (<ulink url="http://botan.randombit.net/"/>).
        It requires at least Botan version 1.8.
      </para>

      <para>
        BIND 10 uses the log4cplus C++ logging library
        (<ulink url="http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/"/>).
        It requires at least log4cplus version 1.0.3.
<!-- TODO: It is recommended to use at least version .... -->
      </para>

      <para>
        The authoritative DNS server uses SQLite3
        (<ulink url="http://www.sqlite.org/"/>).
<!-- TODO: is this still required? -->
        It needs at least SQLite version 3.3.9.

        The <command>b10-ddns</command>, <command>b10-xfrin</command>,
        <command>b10-xfrout</command>, and <command>b10-zonemgr</command>
        components require the libpython3 library and the Python
        _sqlite3.so module (which is included with Python).
        Python modules need to be built for the corresponding Python 3.

      <title>Starting and Stopping the Server</title>

      <para>
        BIND 10 is modular.  Part of this modularity is
        accomplished using multiple cooperating processes which, together,
        provide the server functionality.  This is a change from
        the previous generation of BIND software, which used a
        single process.
      </para>

      <para>
        At first, running many different processes may seem confusing.
        However, these processes are started, stopped, and maintained
        by a single command, <command>bind10</command>.
        This command starts a master process which will start other
        required processes and other processes when configured.
        The processes that may be started by the <command>bind10</command>
        command have names starting with "b10-", including:

          In addition to the run-time requirements (listed in
          <xref linkend="required-software"/>), building BIND 10
          from source code requires various development include headers and
          program development tools.
        </para>

        <note>
          <simpara>
            Some operating systems have split their distribution packages into
            a run-time and a development package.  You will need to install
            the development package versions, which include header files and
            libraries, to build BIND 10 from source code.

        <para>
          Building from source code requires the Boost
          build-time headers
          (<ulink url="http://www.boost.org/"/>).
          At least Boost version 1.35 is required.
  <!-- TODO: we don't check for this version -->
  <!-- NOTE: jreed has tested with 1.34, 1.38, and 1.41. -->
        </para>

        <para>
          To build BIND 10, also install the Botan (at least version
          1.8) and the log4cplus (at least version 1.0.3)
          development include headers.
        </para>

<!--
TODO
Debian and Ubuntu:
 libgmp3-dev and libbz2-dev required for botan too
-->

<!-- NOTE: _sqlite3 is only needed at test time; it is already listed
as a dependency earlier -->

        <para>
          Building BIND 10 also requires a C++ compiler and
          standard development headers, make, and pkg-config.
          BIND 10 builds have been tested with GCC g++ 3.4.3, 4.1.2,
          4.1.3, 4.2.1, 4.3.2, and 4.4.1; Clang++ 2.8; and Sun C++ 5.10.

    <para>
      BIND 10 provides the <command>bind10</command> command which
      starts up the required processes.
      <command>bind10</command>
      will also restart some processes that exit unexpectedly.
      This is the only command needed to start the BIND 10 system.
    </para>

    <para>
      After starting the <command>b10-msgq</command> communications channel,
      <command>bind10</command> connects to it,
      runs the configuration manager, and reads its own configuration.
      Then it starts the other modules.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>b10-sockcreator</command>, <command>b10-msgq</command> and
      <command>b10-cfgmgr</command>
      services make up the core. The <command>b10-msgq</command> daemon
      provides the communication channel between every part of the system.
      The <command>b10-cfgmgr</command> daemon is always needed by every
      module, if only to send information about themselves somewhere,
      but more importantly to ask about their own settings, and
      about other modules. The <command>b10-sockcreator</command> daemon
      helps allocate Internet addresses and ports as needed for BIND 10
      network services.
    </para>

    <para>
      In its default configuration, the <command>bind10</command>
      master process will also start up
      <command>b10-cmdctl</command> for administration tools to

      <para>
        The BIND 10 components use the <command>b10-msgq</command>
        message routing daemon to communicate with other BIND 10 components.
        The <command>b10-msgq</command> implements what is called the
        <quote>Command Channel</quote>.
        Processes intercommunicate by sending messages on the command
        channel.
        Example messages include shutdown, get configurations, and set
        configurations.
        This Command Channel is not used for DNS message passing.
        It is used only to control and monitor the BIND 10 system.

    <note><para>
      For the current release, <command>bindctl</command>
      is the only user interface. It is expected that upcoming
      releases will provide another interactive command-line
      interface and a web-based interface for controlling and
      configuring BIND 10.
    </para></note>

    <note><para>
      <command>bindctl</command> has an internal command history, as
      well as tab-completion for most of the commands and arguments.
      However, these are only enabled if the python readline module
      is available on the system. If not, neither of these
      features will be supported.
    </para></note>

    <para>
      The <command>bindctl</command> tool provides an interactive
      prompt for configuring, controlling, and querying the BIND 10
      components.
      It communicates directly with a REST-ful interface over HTTPS
      provided by <command>b10-cmdctl</command>. It doesn't
      communicate to any other components directly.

        <title>General syntax of bindctl commands</title>
        The <command>bindctl</command> tool is an interactive
        command-line tool, with dynamic commands depending on the
        BIND 10 modules that are running. There are a number of
        fixed commands that have no module and that are always
        available.

        The general syntax of a command is

        <screen><userinput>&lt;module&gt; &lt;command&gt; <replaceable>[argument(s)]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

        For example, the Boss module has a 'shutdown' command to shut down
        BIND 10, with an optional argument 'help':

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>Boss shutdown help</userinput>
Command  shutdown 	(Shut down BIND 10)
		help (Get help for command)
This command has no parameters
        </screen>
        There are no mandatory arguments, only the optional 'help'.
    </section>

    <section id="bindctl_help">
        <title>Bindctl help</title>
        <command>help</command> is both a command and an option that is available to all other commands. When run as a command directly, it shows the available modules.
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>help</userinput>
usage: &lt;module name&gt; &lt;command name&gt; [param1 = value1 [, param2 = value2]]
Type Tab character to get the hint of module/command/parameters.
Type "help(? h)" for help on bindctl.
Type "&lt;module_name&gt; help" for help on the specific module.
Type "&lt;module_name&gt; &lt;command_name&gt; help" for help on the specific command.

Available module names:
<emphasis>(list of modules)</emphasis>
        </screen>

        When 'help' is used as a command to a module, it shows the supported commands for the module; for example:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>Boss help</userinput>
Module  Boss 	Master process
Available commands:
    help        Get help for module.
    shutdown    Shut down BIND 10
    ping        Ping the boss process
    show_processes
            List the running BIND 10 processes
        </screen>

    And when added to a module command, it shows the description and parameters of that specific command; for example:
    <screen>&gt; <userinput>Auth loadzone help</userinput>
Command  loadzone 	((Re)load a specified zone)
		help (Get help for command)
Parameters:
    class (string, optional)
    origin (string, mandatory)
    </screen>

    </section>

    <section id="bindctl_command_arguments">
        <title>Command arguments</title>
        <simpara>
            Commands can have arguments, which can be either optional or
            mandatory. They can be specified by name
            (e.g. <command><replaceable>&lt;command&gt;</replaceable> <replaceable>&lt;argument name&gt;=&lt;argument value&gt;</replaceable></command>), or positionally,
            (e.g. <command><replaceable>&lt;command&gt;</replaceable> <replaceable>&lt;argument value 1&gt;</replaceable> <replaceable>&lt;argument value 2&gt;</replaceable></command>).
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
            <command><replaceable>&lt;command&gt;</replaceable> <replaceable>help</replaceable></command>
            shows the arguments a command supports and which of those are
            mandatory, and in which order the arguments are expected if
            positional arguments are used.
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
            For example, the <command>loadzone</command> command of the Auth
            module, as shown in the last example of the previous section, has
            two arguments, one of which is optional. The positional arguments in
            this case are class first and origin second; for example:
            <screen>&gt; <userinput>Auth loadzone IN example.com.</userinput></screen>
            But since the class is optional (defaulting to IN), leaving it out
            works as well:
            <screen>&gt; <userinput>Auth loadzone example.com.</userinput></screen>
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
            The arguments can also be provided with their names, in which
            case the order does not matter:
            <screen>&gt; <userinput>Auth loadzone origin="example.com." class="IN"</userinput></screen>
        </simpara>
    </section>

    <section id="bindctl_module_commands">
        <title>Module commands</title>
        Each module has its own set of commands (if any), which will only be
        available if the module is running. For instance, the
        Auth module has a <command>loadzone</command> command.
        The commands a module provides are documented in
        this guide in the section of that module or in the module's
        corresponding manual page.
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>Configuration commands</title>
        Configuration commands are used to view and change the configuration
        of BIND 10 and its modules. Module configuration is only shown if
        that module is running, but similar to commands, there are a number
        of top-level configuration items that are always available (for
        instance <varname>tsig_keys</varname> and
        <varname>data_sources</varname>).

        Configuration changes (set, unset, add and remove) are done locally
        first, and have no immediate effect. The changes can be viewed with
        <command>config diff</command>, and either reverted
        (<command>config revert</command>), or committed
        (<command>config commit</command>).
        In the latter case, all local changes are submitted
        to the configuration manager, which verifies them, and if they are
        accepted, applied and saved in persistent storage.

        When identifying items in configuration commands, the format is
        <screen><userinput>Module/example/item</userinput></screen>
        Sub-elements of names, lists and sets (see <xref linkend=
        "bindctl_configuration_data_types"/>) are separated with the '/'
        character, and list indices are identified with [<replaceable>&lt;index&gt;</replaceable>]; for example:

        <screen><userinput>Module/example/list[2]/foo</userinput></screen>

        <section id="bindctl_configuration_command_list">
        <title>List of configuration commands</title>
        The following configuration commands are available:
        <variablelist>

            <term>show [all] [item name]</term>

                Add an entry to configuration list or a named set (see <xref
                linkend="bindctl_configuration_data_types"/>).
                When adding to a list, the command has one optional
                argument, a value to add to the list. The value must
                be in correct JSON and complete. When adding to a
                named set, it has one mandatory parameter (the name to
                add), and an optional parameter value, similar to when
                adding to a list. In either case, when no value is
                given, an entry will be constructed with default
                values.

                When removing an item for a list, either the index needs to
                be specified, or the complete value of the element to remove
                must be specified (in JSON format).

                        Maps are (pre-defined) compound collections of other
                        elements of any other type. They are not usually
                        modified directly, but their elements are. Every
                        top-level element for a module is a map containing
                        the configuration values for that map, which can
                        themselves be maps again. For instance, the Auth

                        elements '<varname>listen_on</varname>' (list) and '<varname>tcp_recv_timeout</varname>'
                        (integer). When changing one of its values, they can
                        be modified directly with <command>config set
                        Auth/tcp_recv_timeout 3000</command>.
                    </simpara>
                    <simpara>
                        Some map entries are optional. If they are, and
                        currently have a value, the value can be unset by
                        using either <command>config unset
                        <replaceable>&lt;item name&gt;</replaceable>
                        </command> or <command>config set
                        <replaceable>&lt;item name&gt;</replaceable>
                        null</command>.

                    </simpara>
                    <simpara>
                        Maps <emphasis>can</emphasis> be modified as a whole,
                        but using the full JSON representation of
                        the entire map to set.

                        Since this involves a lot of text, this is usually
                        not recommended.

                    <simpara>
                        Another example is the Logging virtual module, which
                        is, like any module, a map, but it only contains one
                        element: a list of loggers. Normally, an
                        administrator would only modify that list (or its
                        elements) directly, but it is possible to set the
                        entire map in one command; for example:
                        <command> config set Logging { "loggers": [] } </command>
                    </simpara>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>
                <term>list</term>
                <listitem>
                    <simpara>
                        A list is a compound list of other elements of the
                        same type. Elements can be added with <command>config
                        add <replaceable>&lt;list name&gt; [value]</replaceable></command>, and removed with
                        <command>config remove <replaceable>&lt;list name&gt; [value]</replaceable></command> or
                        <command>config remove <replaceable>&lt;list name&gt;</replaceable><replaceable>&lt;index&gt;</replaceable></command>.
                        The index is of the form <emphasis>square bracket, number,
                        square bracket</emphasis> (e.g.
                        <command>[0]</command>), and it immediately follows
                        the list name (there is no separator or space
                        between them). List indices start with 0 for the
                        first element.
                    </simpara>
                    <simpara>
                        For addition, if the value is omitted, an entry with
                        default values will be added. For removal, either
                        the index or the full value (in JSON format) needs
                        to be specified.
                    </simpara>
                    <simpara>
                        Lists can also be used with
                        <command>config set</command>,
                        but like maps, only by specifying the
                        entire list value in JSON format.
                    </simpara>
                    <simpara>
                        For example, this command shows the port number used for the second element of the list <varname>listen_on</varname> in the Auth module:
                        <command> config show Auth/listen_on[1]/port</command>
                    </simpara>

                        Named sets are similar to lists, in that they are
                        sets of elements of the same type, but they are not
                        indexed by numbers, but by strings.

                    <simpara>
                        Values can be added with
                        <command>config add <replaceable>&lt;item name&gt; &lt;string&gt; [value]</replaceable></command>
                        where 'string' is the name of the element. If 'value'
                        is ommitted, default values will be used. Elements
                        can be removed with <command>config remove
                        <replaceable>&lt;item
                        name&gt; &lt;string&gt;</replaceable></command>

                    <simpara>
                        Elements in a named set can be addressed similarly
                        to maps.

                        adding, showing, and then removing an element
                        can be done with the following three commands (note

                        The 'any' type is a special type that can have any
                        form. Apart from that, it must consist of elements as
                        described in this chapter, there is no restriction
                        on which element types are used. This type is used
                        in places where different data formats could be
                        used. Element modification commands depend on the
                        actual type of the value. For instance, if the value
                        of an 'any' element is a list, <command>config add
                        </command> and <command>config remove</command> work
                        as for other lists.

        <title>The execute command</title>
        The <command>execute</command> command executes a set of commands,
        either from a file
        or from a pre-defined set. Currently, the only predefined set is
        <command>init_authoritative_server</command>, which adds
        <command>b10-auth</command>, <command>b10-xfrin</command>, and
        <command>b10-xfrout</command> to the set of components to be
        started by BIND 10. This
        pre-defined set does not commit the changes, so these modules do not
        show up for commands or configuration until the user enters
        <command>config commit</command> after
        <command>execute init_authoritative_server</command>. For example:

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>execute init_authoritative_server</userinput></screen>

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>execute file /tmp/example_commands</userinput></screen>

        The optional argument <command>show</command> displays the exact set of
        commands that would be executed; for example:

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>execute init_authoritative_server show</userinput>
!echo adding Authoritative server component
config add /Boss/components b10-auth
config set /Boss/components/b10-auth/kind needed
config set /Boss/components/b10-auth/special auth
!echo adding Xfrin component
config add /Boss/components b10-xfrin
config set /Boss/components/b10-xfrin/address Xfrin
config set /Boss/components/b10-xfrin/kind dispensable
!echo adding Xfrout component
config add /Boss/components b10-xfrout
config set /Boss/components/b10-xfrout/address Xfrout
config set /Boss/components/b10-xfrout/kind dispensable
!echo adding Zone Manager component
config add /Boss/components b10-zonemgr
config set /Boss/components/b10-zonemgr/address Zonemgr
config set /Boss/components/b10-zonemgr/kind dispensable
!echo Components added. Please enter "config commit" to
!echo finalize initial setup and run the components.
        </screen>

        The optional <command>show</command> argument may also be used when
        executing a script from a file; for example:

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>execute file /tmp/example_commands show</userinput></screen>

            Within scripts, you can add or remove modules with the normal
            configuration commands for <command>Boss/components</command>.
            However, as module
            configuration and commands do not show up until the module is
            running, it is currently not possible to add a module and set
            its configuration in one script. This will be addressed in the
            future, but for now the only option is to add and configure
            modules in separate commands and execute scripts.

      <title>TSIG keys</title>

      <para>
        TSIG is a way to sign requests and responses in DNS. It is defined in
        RFC 2845 and uses symmetric cryptography to sign the DNS messages. If
        you want to make any use of TSIG (to authenticate transfers or DDNS,
        for example), you need to set up shared secrets between the endpoints.
      </para>

      <para>
        BIND 10 uses a global key ring for the secrets. It doesn't currently
        mean they would be stored differently, they are just in one place of
        the configuration.
      </para>

      <section id='tsig-key-syntax'>
        <title>Key anatomy and syntax</title>

        <para>
          Each key has three attributes. One is a name by which it is referred
          both in DNS packets and the rest of the configuration. Another is the
          algorithm used to compute the signature. And the last part is a
          base64 encoded secret, which might be any blob of data.
        </para>

        <para>
          The parts are written into a string, concatenated together by colons.
          So if you wanted to have a key called "example.key", used as a
          HMAC-MD5 key with secret "secret", you'd write it as:
<screen>"example.key.:c2VjcmV0:hmac-md5"</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          The HMAC-MD5 algorithm is the default, so you can omit it. You could
          write the same key as:
<screen>"example.key.:c2VjcmV0"</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          You can also use these algorithms (which may not be omitted from the
          key definition if used):
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>hmac-sha1</listitem>
            <listitem>hmac-sha224</listitem>

            <listitem>hmac-sha512</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </para>

        <para>
          The name of the key must be a valid DNS name.

      </section>

      <section id='tsig-key-ring'>
        <title>Key ring</title>
        <para>
          The key ring lives in the configuration in "tsig_keys/keys". Most of
          the system uses the keys from there &mdash; ACLs, authoritative server to
          sign responses to signed queries, and <command>b10-xfrin</command>
          and <command>b10-xfrout</command> to sign transfers.
        </para>

        <para>
          The key ring is just a list of strings, each describing one key. So,
          to add a new key, you can do this:
          <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add tsig_keys/keys "example.key.:c2VjcmV0"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config show tsig_keys/keys</userinput>
tsig_keys/keys[0]   "example.key.:c2VjcmV0" string  (modified)
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          You can keep as many keys as you want in the key ring, but each must
          have a different name.

    </section>

    <section id='common-acl'>
      <title>ACLs</title>

      <para>
        An ACL, or Access Control List, is a way to describe if a request
        is allowed or disallowed. The principle is, there's a list of rules.
        Each rule is a name-value mapping (a dictionary, in the JSON
        terminology). Each rule must contain exactly one mapping called
        "action", which describes what should happen if the rule applies.
        There may be more mappings, calld matches, which describe the
        conditions under which the rule applies.
      </para>

      <para>
        When there's a query, the first rule is examined. If it matches, the
        action in it is taken. If not, next rule is examined. If there are no
        more rules to examine, a default action is taken.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are three possible "action" values. The "ACCEPT" value means
        the query is handled. If it is "REJECT", the query is not answered,
        but a polite error message is sent back (if that makes sense in the
        context). The "DROP" action acts like a black hole. The query is
        not answered and no error message is sent.
      </para>

      <para>
        If there are multiple matching conditions inside the rule, all of
        them must be satisfied for the rule to apply. This can be used,
        for example, to require the query to be signed by a TSIG key and
        originate from given address.
      </para>

      <para>

        <para>
          The other is TSIG key by which the message was signed. The ACL
          contains only the name (under the name "key"), the key itself
	  must be stored in the global key ring (see <xref
	  linkend="tsig-key-ring"/>).
          This property is applicable only to the DNS context.
        </para>

        <para>
          More properties to match are planned &mdash; the destination
          address, ports, matches against the packet content.

        <title>More complicated matches</title>

        <para>
          From time to time, you need to express something more complex
          than just a single address or key.
        </para>

        <para>
          You can specify a list of values instead of single value. Then
          the property needs to match at least one of the values listed
          &mdash; so you can say <quote>"from": ["192.0.2.0/24",
          "2001:db8::/32"]</quote> to match any address in the ranges
          set aside for documentation. The keys or any future properties
          will work in a similar way.
        </para>

        <para>
          If that is not enough, you can compose the matching conditions
          to logical expressions. They are called "ANY", "ALL" and "NOT".
          The "ANY" and "ALL" ones contain lists of subexpressions &mdash;
          each subexpression is a similar dictionary, just not containing
          the "action" element. The "NOT" contains single subexpression.
          Their function should be obvious &mdash; "NOT" matches if and
          only if the subexpression does not match. The "ALL" matches exactly
          when each of the subexpressions matches and "ANY" when at least
          one matches.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Examples</title>

        <para>
          All the examples here is just the JSON representing the ACL,
          nicely formatted and split across lines. They are out of any
          surrounding context. This is similar to what you'd get from
          <command>config show_json</command> called on the entry containing
          the ACL.
        </para>

        <para>
          In the first example, the ACL accepts queries from two known hosts.
          Each host has an IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) and a TSIG
          key. Other queries are politely rejected. The last entry in the list
          has no conditions &mdash; making it match any query.

          <screen>[
  {
    "from": ["192.0.2.1", "2001:db8::1"],
    "key": "first.key",
    "action": "ACCEPT"
  },
  {
    "from": ["192.0.2.2", "2001:db8::2"],

  },
  {
    "action": "REJECT"
  }
]</screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          Now we show two ways to accept only the queries from private ranges.
          This is the same as rejecting anything that is outside.

    ],
    "action": "ACCEPT"
  },
  {
    "action": "REJECT"
  }
]</screen>

          set the whole entry at once, providing the whole JSON value.

          This limitation is planned to be solved soon at least partially.
        </para>

      <title>Configuration to start processes</title>

      <para>
	The processes to be used can be configured for

	of the required <command>b10-sockcreator</command>,
	<command>b10-msgq</command> and <command>b10-cfgmgr</command>
	components.
	The configuration is in the <varname>Boss/components</varname>
	section. Each element represents one component, which is
	an abstraction of a process.
      </para>

      <para>
	To add a process to the set, let's say the resolver (which
	is not started by default), you would do this:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/special resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/kind needed</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/priority 10</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen></para>

      <para>
	Now, what it means. We add an entry called
	<quote>b10-resolver</quote>. It is both a name used to
	reference this component in the configuration and the name
	of the process to start. Then we set some parameters on
	how to start it.
      </para>

      <para>
	The <varname>special</varname> setting is for components
	that need some kind of special care during startup or
	shutdown. Unless specified, the component is started in a
	usual way. This is the list of components that need to be
	started in a special way, with the value of special used
	for them:

      <para>
	The <varname>kind</varname> specifies how a failure of the
	component should be handled.  If it is set to
	<quote>dispensable</quote> (the default unless you set
	something else), it will get started again if it fails. If
	it is set to <quote>needed</quote> and it fails at startup,
	the whole <command>bind10</command> shuts down and exits
	with an error exit code. But if it fails some time later, it
	is just started again. If you set it to <quote>core</quote>,
	you indicate that the system is not usable without the
	component and if such component fails, the system shuts
	down no matter when the failure happened.  This is the
	behavior of the core components (the ones you can't turn
	off), but you can declare any other components as core as
	well if you wish (but you can turn these off, they just
	can't fail).
      </para>

      <para>
	The <varname>priority</varname> defines order in which the
	components should start.  The ones with higher numbers are
	started sooner than the ones with lower ones. If you don't
	set it, 0 (zero) is used as the priority.  Usually, leaving
	it at the default is enough.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are other parameters we didn't use in our example.
        One of them is <varname>address</varname>. It is the address
        used by the component on the <command>b10-msgq</command>
        message bus. The special components already know their
        address, but the usual ones don't. The address is by
        convention the thing after <emphasis>b10-</emphasis>, with
        the first letter capitalized (eg. <command>b10-stats</command>
        would have <quote>Stats</quote> as its address).
<!-- TODO: this should be simplified so we don't even have to document it -->

<!-- TODO: document params when is enabled -->

      <para>
	The last one is <varname>process</varname>. It is the name
	of the process to be started.  It defaults to the name of
	the component if not set, but you can use this to override
	it. (The special components also already know their
        executable name.)
      </para>

      <!-- TODO Add parameters when they work, not implemented yet-->

      <note>
        <para>
          The configuration is quite powerful, but that includes
          a lot of space for mistakes. You could turn off the
          <command>b10-cmdctl</command>, but then you couldn't
          change it back the usual way, as it would require it to
          be running (you would have to find and edit the configuration
          directly).  Also, some modules might have dependencies:
          <command>b10-stats-httpd</command> needs
          <command>b10-stats</command>, <command>b10-xfrout</command>
          needs <command>b10-auth</command> to be running, etc.

<!-- TODO: should we define dependencies? -->

        </para>
        <para>
          In short, you should think twice before disabling something here.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        It is possible to start some components multiple times (currently
        <command>b10-auth</command> and <command>b10-resolver</command>).
        You might want to do that to gain more performance (each one uses only
        single core). Just put multiple entries under different names, like
        this, with the same config:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-resolver-2</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver-2/special resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver-2/kind needed</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        However, this is work in progress and the support is not yet complete.
        For example, each resolver will have its own cache, each authoritative
        server will keep its own copy of in-memory data and there could be
        problems with locking the sqlite database, if used. The configuration
        might be changed to something more convenient in future.
	Other components don't expect such a situation, so it would
	probably not do what you want. Such support is yet to be
	implemented.

      <note>
        <simpara>
          The default configuration is currently not appropriate for a multi-homed host.
          In case you have multiple public IP addresses, it is possible the
          query UDP packet comes through one interface and the answer goes out
          through another. The answer will probably be dropped by the client, as it
          has a different source address than the one it sent the query to. The
          client would fallback on TCP after several attempts, which works
          well in this situation, but is clearly not ideal.
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
          There are plans to solve the problem such that the server handles
          it by itself. But until it is actually implemented, it is recommended to
          alter the configuration &mdash; remove the wildcard addresses and list all
          addresses explicitly. Then the server will answer on the same
          interface the request came on, preserving the correct address.

      <para>
        Bind 10 has the concept of data sources. A data source is a place
        where authoritative zone data reside and where they can be served
        from. This can be a master file, a database or something completely
        different.
      </para>

        class. The default contains two classes. The CH class contains a static
        data source &mdash; one that serves things like
        <quote>AUTHORS.BIND.</quote>. The IN class contains single SQLite3
        data source with database file located at
        <filename>/usr/local/var/bind10-devel/zone.sqlite3</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
        Each data source has several options. The first one is
        <varname>type</varname>, which specifies the type of data source to
        use. Valid types include the ones listed below, but BIND 10 uses
        dynamically loaded modules for them, so there may be more in your
        case. This option is mandatory.
      </para>

      <para>
        Another option is <varname>params</varname>. This option is type
        specific; it holds different data depending on the type
        above. Also, depending on the type, it could be possible to omit it.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are two options related to the so-called cache. If you enable
        cache, zone data from the data source are loaded into memory.
        Then, when answering a query, <command>b10-auth</command> looks
        into the memory only instead of the data source, which speeds
        answering up. The first option is <varname>cache-enable</varname>,
        a boolean value turning the cache on and off (off is the default).
        The second one, <varname>cache-zones</varname>, is a list of zone
        origins to load into in-memory.

<!-- NOT YET:  http://bind10.isc.org/ticket/2240
 Once the cache is enabled,
        the zones in the data source not listed in
        <varname>cache-zones</varname> will not be loaded and will
        not be available at all.

      </para>

      <section id='datasource-types'>
        <title>Data source types</title>
        <para>
          As mentioned, the type used by default is <quote>sqlite3</quote>.
          It has single configuration option inside <varname>params</varname>
          &mdash; <varname>database_file</varname>, which contains the path
          to the SQLite3 file containing the data.
        </para>

        <para>
          Another type is called <quote>MasterFiles</quote>. This one is
          slightly special. The data are stored in RFC1034 master files.
          Because answering directly from them would be impractical,
          this type mandates the cache to be enabled. Also, the list of
          zones (<varname>cache-zones</varname>) should be omitted. The
          <varname>params</varname> is a dictionary mapping from zone
          origins to the files they reside in.

        <title>Examples</title>
        <para>
          As this is one of the more complex configurations of BIND 10,
          we show some examples. They all assume they start with default
          configuration.
        </para>

        <para>
          First, let's disable the static data source
          (<quote>VERSION.BIND</quote> and friends). As it is the only
          data source in the CH class, we can remove the whole class.

          <screen>&gt; <userinput>config remove data_sources/classes CH</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        </para>

        <para>
          Another one, let's say our default data source contains zones
          <quote>example.org.</quote> and <quote>example.net.</quote>.
          We want them to be served from memory to make the answering
          faster.

          <screen>&gt; <userinput>config set data_sources/classes/IN[0]/cache-enable true</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config add data_sources/classes/IN[0]/cache-zones example.org.</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config add data_sources/classes/IN[0]/cache-zones example.net.</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>

          Now every time the zone in the data source is changed by the
          operator, the authoritative server needs to be told to reload it, by
          <screen>&gt; <userinput>Auth loadzone example.org</userinput></screen>
          You don't need to do this when the zone is modified by
          <command>b10-xfrin</command>; it does so automatically.
        </para>

        <para>
          Now, the last example is when there are master files we want to
          serve in addition to whatever is inside the SQLite3 database.

          <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add data_sources/classes/IN</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set data_sources/classes/IN[1]/type MasterFiles</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set data_sources/classes/IN[1]/cache-enable true</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set data_sources/classes/IN[1]/params { "example.org": "/path/to/example.org", "example.com": "/path/to/example.com" }</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>

          Initially, a map value has to be set, but this value may be an
          empty map. After that, key/value pairs can be added with 'config
          add' and keys can be removed with 'config remove'. The initial
          value may be an empty map, but it has to be set before zones are
          added or removed.

          <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config set data_sources/classes/IN[1]/params {}</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config add data_sources/classes/IN[1]/params another.example.org /path/to/another.example.org</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config add data_sources/classes/IN[1]/params another.example.com /path/to/another.example.com</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config remove data_sources/classes/IN[1]/params another.example.org</userinput>
          </screen>

          <command>bindctl</command>. To reload a zone, you the same command
          as above.
        </para>
      </section>

      <note>
      <para>
        There's also <varname>Auth/database_file</varname> configuration
        variable, pointing to a SQLite3 database file. This is no longer
        used by <command>b10-auth</command>, but it is left in place for
        now, since other modules use it. Once <command>b10-xfrin</command>,
        <command>b10-xfrout</command> and <command>b10-ddns</command>
        are ported to the new configuration, this will disappear. But for
        now, make sure that if you use any of these modules, the new
        and old configuration correspond. The defaults are consistent, so
        unless you tweaked either the new or the old configuration, you're
        good.

    <title>Incoming Zone Transfers</title>

    <para>
      Incoming zones are transferred using the <command>b10-xfrin</command>
      process which is started by <command>bind10</command>.
      When received, the zone is stored in the corresponding BIND 10
      data source, and its records can be served by
      <command>b10-auth</command>.
      In combination with <command>b10-zonemgr</command> (for
      automated SOA checks), this allows the BIND 10 server to
      provide <emphasis>secondary</emphasis> service.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>b10-xfrin</command> process supports both AXFR and
      IXFR.  Due to some implementation limitations of the current
      development release, however, it only tries AXFR by default,
      and care should be taken to enable IXFR.
    </para>
<!-- TODO: http://bind10.isc.org/ticket/1279 -->

    <section>
      <title>Configuration for Incoming Zone Transfers</title>
      <para>
        In practice, you need to specify a list of secondary zones to
        enable incoming zone transfers for these zones (you can still
        trigger a zone transfer manually, without a prior configuration
        (see below)).
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, to enable zone transfers for a zone named "example.com"
        (whose master address is assumed to be 2001:db8::53 here),
        run the following at the <command>bindctl</command> prompt:

      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Xfrin/zones</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/name "<option>example.com</option>"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/master_addr "<option>2001:db8::53</option>"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>

      (We assume there has been no zone configuration before).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>TSIG</title>
        If you want to use TSIG for incoming transfers, a system wide TSIG
        key ring must be configured (see <xref linkend="tsig-key-ring"/>).
        To specify a key to use, set tsig_key value to the name of the key
        to use from the key ring.
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/tsig_key "<option>example.key</option>"</userinput>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Enabling IXFR</title>
      <para>
        As noted above, <command>b10-xfrin</command> uses AXFR for
        zone transfers by default.  To enable IXFR for zone transfers
        for a particular zone, set the <varname>use_ixfr</varname>
        configuration parameter to <quote>true</quote>.
        In the above example of configuration sequence, you'll need
        to add the following before performing <userinput>commit</userinput>:
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/use_ixfr true</userinput></screen>
      </para>

<!-- TODO: http://bind10.isc.org/ticket/1279 -->
      <note><simpara>
      One reason why IXFR is disabled by default in the current
      release is because it does not support automatic fallback from IXFR to
      AXFR when it encounters a primary server that doesn't support
      outbound IXFR (and, not many existing implementations support
      it).  Another, related reason is that it does not use AXFR even
      if it has no knowledge about the zone (like at the very first
      time the secondary server is set up).  IXFR requires the
      "current version" of the zone, so obviously it doesn't work
      in this situation and AXFR is the only workable choice.
      The current release of <command>b10-xfrin</command> does not
      make this selection automatically.
      These features will be implemented in a near future
      version, at which point we will enable IXFR by default.

    <title>Dynamic DNS Update</title>

    <para>
      BIND 10 supports the server side of the Dynamic DNS Update
      (DDNS) protocol as defined in RFC 2136.
      This service is provided by the <command>b10-ddns</command>
      component, which is started by the <command>bind10</command>
      process if configured so.
    </para>

    <para>
      When the <command>b10-auth</command> authoritative DNS server
      receives an UPDATE request, it internally forwards the request
      to <command>b10-ddns</command>, which handles the rest of
      this request processing.
      When the processing is completed, <command>b10-ddns</command>
      will send a response to the client as specified in RFC 2136
      (NOERROR for successful update, REFUSED if rejected due to
      ACL check, etc).
      If the zone has been changed as a result, it will internally
      notify <command>b10-xfrout</command> so that other secondary
      servers will be notified via the DNS NOTIFY protocol.
      In addition, if <command>b10-auth</command> serves the updated
      zone (as described in
      <xref linkend="datasrc" />),
      <command>b10-ddns</command> will also
      notify <command>b10-auth</command> so that <command>b10-auth</command>
      will re-cache the updated zone content if necessary.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>b10-ddns</command> component supports requests over
      both UDP and TCP, and both IPv6 and IPv4; for TCP requests,
      however, it terminates the TCP connection immediately after
      each single request has been processed.  Clients cannot reuse the
      same TCP connection for multiple requests. (This is a current
      implementation limitation of <command>b10-ddns</command>.
      While RFC 2136 doesn't specify anything about such reuse of TCP
      connection, there is no reason for disallowing it as RFC 1035
      generally allows multiple requests sent over a single TCP
      connection.  BIND 9 supports such reuse.)
    </para>

    <para>
      As of this writing <command>b10-ddns</command> does not support
      update forwarding for secondary zones.
      If it receives an update request for a secondary zone, it will
      immediately return a <quote>not implemented</quote> response.
      <note><simpara>
	  For feature completeness, update forwarding should be
	  eventually supported.  But currently it's considered a lower
	  priority task and there is no specific plan of implementing
	  this feature.

        In addition, <command>b10-xfrout</command> should also be

        (see above) will fail with a timeout, suspending the DDNS
        service while <command>b10-ddns</command> waits for the
        response (see the description of the <ulink
        url="bind10-messages.html#DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL">DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL</ulink>
        log message for further details).
        If BIND 10 is already configured to provide authoritative DNS
        service they should normally be configured to run already.
      </para>

      <para>
        Second, for the obvious reason dynamic update requires that the
        underlying data source storing the zone data be writable.
        In the current implementation this means the zone must be stored
        in an SQLite3-based data source.
<!-- TODO -->
	Also, in this current version, the <command>b10-ddns</command>
	component configures itself with the data source referring to the
        <varname>database_file</varname> configuration parameter of
        <command>b10-auth</command>.
        So this information must be configured correctly before starting
        <command>b10-ddns</command>.

        <note><simpara>
            The way to configure data sources is now being revised.
            Configuration on the data source for DDNS will be very
            likely to be changed in a backward incompatible manner in
            a near future version.
        </simpara></note>
      </para>

      <para>
	In general, if something goes wrong regarding the dependency
	described above, <command>b10-ddns</command> will log the
	related event at the warning or error level.
	It's advisable to check the log message when you first enable
	DDNS or if it doesn't work as you expect to see if there's any
	warning or error log message.
      </para>

      <para>
        Next, to enable the DDNS service, <command>b10-ddns</command>
        needs to be explicitly configured to run.
        It can be done by using the <command>bindctl</command>
        utility.  For example:
      <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-ddns</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-ddns/address DDNS</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-ddns/kind dispensable</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput>
</screen>
      <note><simpara>
	  In theory <varname>kind</varname> could be omitted because
	  "dispensable" is its default.
	  But there's some peculiar behavior (which should be a
	  bug and should be fixed eventually; see Trac ticket #2064)
	  with <command>bindctl</command> and you'll still need to
	  specify that explicitly.  Likewise, <varname>address</varname>
	  may look unnecessary because <command>b10-ddns</command>
	  would start and work without specifying it.  But for it
	  to shutdown gracefully this parameter should also be
	  specified.

      <title>Access Control</title>
      <para>
        By default, <command>b10-ddns</command> rejects any update
        requests from any clients by returning a REFUSED response.
        To allow updates to take effect, an access control rule
        (called update ACL) with a policy allowing updates must explicitly be
        configured.
        Update ACL must be configured per zone basis in the
        <varname>zones</varname> configuration parameter of
        <command>b10-ddns</command>.
        This is a list of per-zone configurations regarding DDNS.
        Each list element consists of the following parameters:
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>origin</term>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>The zone's origin name</simpara>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>class</term>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>The RR class of the zone
                (normally <quote>IN</quote>, and in that case
		can be omitted in configuration)</simpara>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>update_acl</term>
            <listitem>
              <simpara>List of access control rules (ACL) for the zone</simpara>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
        The syntax of the ACL is the same as ACLs for other
        components.
        Specific examples are given below.
      </para>

      <para>
        In general, an update ACL rule that allows an update request
        should be configured with a TSIG key.
        This is an example update ACL that allows updates to the zone
        named <quote>example.org</quote> (of default RR class <quote>IN</quote>)
        from clients that send requests signed with a TSIG whose
        key name is "key.example.org" (and refuses all others):
      <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add DDNS/zones</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set DDNS/zones[0]/origin example.org</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config add DDNS/zones[0]/update_acl {"action": "ACCEPT", "key": "key.example.org"}</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput>
</screen>
      The TSIG key must be configured system wide
      (see <xref linkend="common-tsig"/>).
      </para>

      <para>
	The full description of ACLs can be found in <xref
	linkend="common-acl" />.
      </para>

      <note><simpara>
          The <command>b10-ddns</command> component accepts an ACL
          rule that just allows updates from a specific IP address
          (i.e., without requiring TSIG), but this is highly
          discouraged (remember that requests can be made over UDP and
          spoofing the source address of a UDP packet is often pretty
          easy).
          Unless you know what you are doing and that you can accept
          its consequence, any update ACL rule that allows updates
          should have a TSIG key in its constraints.
      </simpara></note>

      <para>
        Currently update ACL can only control updates per zone basis;
        it's not possible to specify access control with higher
        granularity such as for particular domain names or specific
        types of RRs.
<!-- See Trac ticket #2065 -->
      </para>

      <note><simpara>
        Contrary to what RFC 2136 (literally) specifies,
        <command>b10-ddns</command> checks the update ACL before
        checking the prerequisites of the update request.
        This is a deliberate implementation decision.
        This counter intuitive specification has been repeatedly
        discussed among implementers and in the IETF, and it is now
        widely agreed that it does not make sense to strictly follow
        that part of RFC.
        One known specific bad result of following the RFC is that it
        could leak information about which name or record exists or does not
        exist in the zone as a result of prerequisite checks even if a
        zone is somehow configured to reject normal queries from
        arbitrary clients.
        There have been other troubles that could have been avoided if
        the ACL could be checked before the prerequisite check.

      <title>Miscellaneous Operational Issues</title>
      <para>
        Unlike BIND 9, BIND 10 currently does not support automatic
        re-signing of DNSSEC-signed zone when it's updated via DDNS.
        It could be possible to re-sign the updated zone afterwards
        or make sure the update request also updates related DNSSEC
        records, but that will be pretty error-prone operation.
        In general, it's not advisable to allow DDNS for a signed zone
        at this moment.
      </para>

      <para>
        Also unlike BIND 9, it's currently not possible
        to <quote>freeze</quote> a zone temporarily in order to
        suspend DDNS while you manually update the zone.
        If you need to make manual updates to a dynamic zone,
        you'll need to temporarily reject any updates to the zone via
        the update ACLs.
      </para>

      <para>
        Dynamic updates are only applicable to primary zones.
        In order to avoid updating secondary zones via DDNS requests,
        <command>b10-ddns</command> refers to the
        <quote>secondary_zones</quote> configuration of
        <command>b10-zonemgr</command>.  Zones listed in
        <quote>secondary_zones</quote> will never be updated via DDNS
        regardless of the update ACL configuration;
	<command>b10-ddns</command> will return a NOTAUTH (server
        not authoritative for the zone) response.
        If you have a "conceptual" secondary zone whose content is a
        copy of some external source but is not updated via the
        standard zone transfers and therefore not listed in
        <quote>secondary_zones</quote>, be careful not to allow DDNS
        for the zone; it would be quite likely to lead to inconsistent
        state between different servers.
        Normally this should not be a problem because the default
        update ACL rejects any update requests, but you may want to
        take an extra care about the configuration if you have such
        type of secondary zones.
      </para>
      <para>
        The difference of two versions of a zone, before and after a
        DDNS transaction, is automatically recorded in the underlying
        data source, and can be retrieved in the form of outbound
        IXFR.
        This is done automatically; it does not require specific
        configuration to make this possible.

      <title>Access Control</title>

      <para>
        By default, the <command>b10-resolver</command> daemon only accepts
        DNS queries from the localhost (127.0.0.1 and ::1).
        The <option>Resolver/query_acl</option> configuration may

        See <xref linkend="common-acl" />.
      </para>

      <para>
	The following session is an example of extending the ACL to also
	allow queries from 192.0.2.0/24:
        <screen>
> <userinput>config show Resolver/query_acl</userinput>
Resolver/query_acl[0]   {"action": "ACCEPT", "from": "127.0.0.1"}   any (default)

> <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
	Note that we didn't set the value of the last final rule
	(query_acl[3]) -- in the case of resolver, rejecting all queries is
	the default value of a new rule.  In fact, this rule can even be
	omitted completely, as the default, when a query falls off the list,

      <title>Forwarding</title>

      <para>

        To enable forwarding, the upstream address and port must be

        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config set Resolver/forward_addresses [{ "address": "<replaceable>192.168.1.1</replaceable>", "port": 53 }]</userinput>

    <title>DHCPv4 Server</title>
    <para>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCP or
    DHCPv4) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
    are protocols that allow one node (server) to provision
    configuration parameters to many hosts and devices (clients). To
    ease deployment in larger networks, additional nodes (relays) may
    be deployed that facilitate communication between servers and
    clients. Even though principles of both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are
    somewhat similar, these are two radically different
    protocols. BIND 10 offers server implementations for both DHCPv4
    and DHCPv6. This chapter is about DHCP for IPv4. For a description
    of the DHCPv6 server, see <xref linkend="dhcp6"/>.</para>

        performing DHCP configuration, it is not fully functional.
        In particular, it does not have a functional lease
        database. This means that they will assign the same, fixed,

        are up, running, are not loopback, and have IPv4 address
        assigned.

        The server will then listen to incoming traffic. Currently
        supported client messages are DISCOVER and REQUEST. The server
        will respond to them with OFFER and ACK, respectively.

        <command>b10-dhcp6</command> is a BIND 10 component and is being
        run under BIND 10 framework. To add a DHCPv6 process to the set of running
        BIND 10 services, you can use following commands in <command>bindctl</command>:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-dhcp6</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-dhcp6/kind dispensable</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
      </para>

       <para>
         To stop running <command>b10-dhcp6</command>, use the
         following command:
         <screen>&gt; <userinput>config remove Boss/components b10-dhcp6</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
       </para>

      <para>
        During start-up the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces that
        are up, running, are not loopback, are multicast-capable, and
        have IPv6 address assigned. It will then listen to incoming traffic. The
        currently supported client messages are SOLICIT and REQUEST. The server
        will respond to them with ADVERTISE and REPLY, respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
        Since the DHCPv6 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </para>

    </section>

    <section id="dhcp6-config">
      <title>DHCPv6 Server Configuration</title>
      <para>
        Once the server has been started, it can be configured. To view the
        current configuration, use the following command in <command>bindctl</command>:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config show Dhcp6</userinput></screen>
        When starting the Dhcp6 daemon for the first time, the default configuration
        will be available. It will look similar to this:
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config show Dhcp6</userinput>
Dhcp6/interface	         "eth0" string	(default)
Dhcp6/renew-timer        1000   integer	(default)
Dhcp6/rebind-timer       2000   integer	(default)
Dhcp6/preferred-lifetime 3000   integer	(default)
Dhcp6/valid-lifetime	 4000   integer	(default)
Dhcp6/subnet6	         []     list    (default)</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        To change one of the parameters, simply follow
        the usual <command>bindctl</command> procedure. For example, to make the
        leases longer, change their valid-lifetime parameter:
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/valid-lifetime 7200</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        Most Dhcp6 parameters are of global scope
        and apply to all defined subnets, unless they are overridden on a
        per-subnet basis.
      </para>

      <para>
        The essential role of a DHCPv6 server is address assignment. For this,
        the server has to be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic
        addresses to be managed. For example, assume that the server
        is connected to a network segment that uses the 2001:db8:1::/64
        prefix. The Administrator of that network has decided that addresses from range
        2001:db8:1::1 to 2001:db8:1::ffff are going to be managed by the Dhcp6
        server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the following way:
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add Dhcp6/subnet6</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/subnet "2001:db8:1::/64"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/pool [ "2001:db8:1::0 - 2001:db8:1::ffff" ]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        Note that subnet is defined as a simple string, but the pool parameter
        is actually a list of pools: for this reason, the pool definition is
        enclosed in square brackets, even though only one range of addresses
        is specified.</para>
        <para>It is possible to define more than one pool in a
        subnet: continuing the previous example, further assume that
        2001:db8:1:0:5::/80 should be also be managed by the server. It could be written as
        2001:db8:1:0:5:: to 2001:db8:1::5:ffff:ffff:ffff, but typing so many 'f's
        is cumbersome. It can be expressed more simply as 2001:db8:1:0:5::/80. Both
        formats are supported by Dhcp6 and can be mixed in the pool list.
        For example, one could define the following pools:
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/pool [ "2001:db8:1::1 - 2001:db8:1::ffff", "2001:db8:1:0:5::/80" ]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
        use as few as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
         The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet. To add a second subnet,
         use a command similar to the following:
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add Dhcp6/subnet6</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[1]/subnet "2001:db8:beef::/48"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[1]/pool [ "2001:db8:beef::/48" ]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        Arrays are counted from 0. subnet[0] refers to the subnet defined in the
        previous example.  The <command>config add Dhcp6/subnet6</command> adds
        another (second) subnet. It can be referred to as
        <command>Dhcp6/subnet6[1]</command>. In this example, we allow server to
        dynamically assign all addresses available in the whole subnet. Although
        very wasteful, it is certainly a valid configuration to dedicate the
        whole /48 subnet for that purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
        When configuring a DHCPv6 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
        attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server should use
        a given pool, it will be able to allocate also first (typically network
        address) address from that pool. For example for pool 2001:db8::/64 the
        2001:db8:: address may be assigned as well. If you want to avoid this,
        please use min-max notation.
      </para>
      <para>
        Options can also be configured: the following commands configure
        the DNS-SERVERS option for all subnets with the following addresses:
        2001:db8:1::1 and 2001:db8:1::2
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add Dhcp6/option-data</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/option-data[0]/name "dns-servers"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/option-data[0]/code 23</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/option-data[0]/data "2001 0DB8 0001 0000 0000 0000</userinput>
        <userinput>0000 0001 2001 0DB8 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0002"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput>
        </screen>
       (The value for the setting of the "data" element is split across two
        lines in this document for clarity: when entering the command, all the
        string should be entered on the same line.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Currently the only way to set option data is to specify the
        data as a string of hexadecimal digits.  It is planned to allow
        alternative ways of specifying the data as a comma-separated list,
        e.g. "2001:db8:1::1,2001:db8:1::2".
      </para>
      <para>
        As with global settings, it is also possible to override options on a
        per-subnet basis, e.g.  the following commands override the global DNS
        servers option for a particular subnet, setting a single DNS server with
        address 2001:db8:1::3.
        <screen>
&gt; <userinput>config add Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/option-data</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/option-data[0]/name "dns-servers"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/option-data[0]/code 23</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Dhcp6/subnet6[0]/option-data[0]/data "2001 0DB8 0001 0000</userinput>
        <userinput>0000 0000 0000 0003"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
        (As before, the setting of the "data" element has been split across two
        lines for clarity.)

      <title>Logging configuration</title>

      <para>

        The logging system in BIND 10 is configured through the
        Logging module. All BIND 10 modules will look at the
        configuration in Logging to see what should be logged and
        to where.

<!-- TODO: what is context of Logging module for readers of this guide? -->

      </para>

      <section>
        <title>Loggers</title>

        <para>

          Within BIND 10, a message is logged through a component
          called a "logger". Different parts of BIND 10 log messages
          through different loggers, and each logger can be configured
          independently of one another.

        </para>

        <para>

          In the Logging module, you can specify the configuration
          for zero or more loggers; any that are not specified will
          take appropriate default values.

        </para>

        <para>

          The three most important elements of a logger configuration
          are the <option>name</option> (the component that is
          generating the messages), the <option>severity</option>
          (what to log), and the <option>output_options</option>
          (where to log).

        </para>

        <section>
          <title>name (string)</title>

          <para>
          Each logger in the system has a name, the name being that
          of the component using it to log messages. For instance,
          if you want to configure logging for the resolver module,
          you add an entry for a logger named <quote>Resolver</quote>. This
          configuration will then be used by the loggers in the
          Resolver module, and all the libraries used by it.
              </para>

<!-- TODO: later we will have a way to know names of all modules

Right now you can only see what their names are if they are running
(a simple 'help' without anything else in bindctl for instance).

 -->

        <para>

          If you want to specify logging for one specific library
          within the module, you set the name to
          <replaceable>module.library</replaceable>.  For example, the
          logger used by the nameserver address store component
          has the full name of <quote>Resolver.nsas</quote>. If
          there is no entry in Logging for a particular library,
          it will use the configuration given for the module.

<!-- TODO: how to know these specific names?

We will either have to document them or tell the administrator to
specify module-wide logging and see what appears...

-->

        </para>

        <para>

<!-- TODO: severity has not been covered yet -->

          To illustrate this, suppose you want the cache library
          to log messages of severity DEBUG, and the rest of the
          resolver code to log messages of severity INFO. To achieve
          this you specify two loggers, one with the name
          <quote>Resolver</quote> and severity INFO, and one with
          the name <quote>Resolver.cache</quote> with severity
          DEBUG. As there are no entries for other libraries (e.g.
          the nsas), they will use the configuration for the module
          (<quote>Resolver</quote>), so giving the desired behavior.

        </para>

        <para>

          One special case is that of a module name of <quote>*</quote>
          (asterisks), which is interpreted as <emphasis>any</emphasis>
          module. You can set global logging options by using this,
          including setting the logging configuration for a library
          that is used by multiple modules (e.g. <quote>*.config</quote>
          specifies the configuration library code in whatever
          module is using it).

        </para>

        <para>

          If there are multiple logger specifications in the
          configuration that might match a particular logger, the
          specification with the more specific logger name takes
          precedence. For example, if there are entries for for
          both <quote>*</quote> and <quote>Resolver</quote>, the
          resolver module &mdash; and all libraries it uses &mdash;
          will log messages according to the configuration in the
          second entry (<quote>Resolver</quote>). All other modules
          will use the configuration of the first entry
          (<quote>*</quote>). If there was also a configuration
          entry for <quote>Resolver.cache</quote>, the cache library
          within the resolver would use that in preference to the
          entry for <quote>Resolver</quote>.

        </para>

        <para>

          One final note about the naming. When specifying the
          module name within a logger, use the name of the module
          as specified in <command>bindctl</command>, e.g.
          <quote>Resolver</quote> for the resolver module,
          <quote>Xfrout</quote> for the xfrout module, etc. When
          the message is logged, the message will include the name
          of the logger generating the message, but with the module
          name replaced by the name of the process implementing
          the module (so for example, a message generated by the
          <quote>Auth.cache</quote> logger will appear in the output
          with a logger name of <quote>b10-auth.cache</quote>).

        </para>

        </section>

        <section>
          <title>severity (string)</title>

        <para>

          This specifies the category of messages logged.
          Each message is logged with an associated severity which
          may be one of the following (in descending order of
          severity):

        <para>

          When the severity of a logger is set to one of these
          values, it will only log messages of that severity, and
          the severities above it. The severity may also be set to
          NONE, in which case all messages from that logger are
          inhibited.

          Each logger can have zero or more

          is true in the second, it will write the log messages

                messages are produced in a short time (e.g. if the logging
                level is set to DEBUG), you may occasionally see some messages
                jumbled up together.  This is due to a combination of the way
                that messages are written to the screen and the unbuffered
                nature of the standard error stream.  If this occurs, it is

          And that's it. Once we have found whatever it was we
          needed the debug messages for, we can simply remove the
          second logger to let the authoritative server use the
          same settings as the rest.

        </para>

        <para>

          And every module will now be using the values from the
          logger named <quote>*</quote>.

      <title>Logging Message Format</title>

      <para>
          Each message written by BIND 10 to the configured logging
          destinations comprises a number of components that identify
          the origin of the message and, if the message indicates
          a problem, information about the problem that may be
          useful in fixing it.
      </para>

      <para>
          Consider the message below logged to a file:
          <screen>2011-06-15 13:48:22.034 ERROR [b10-resolver.asiolink]
    ASIODNS_OPENSOCK error 111 opening TCP socket to 127.0.0.1(53)</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Note: the layout of messages written to the system logging
        file (syslog) may be slightly different.  This message has
        been split across two lines here for display reasons; in the
        logging file, it will appear on one line.)
      </para>

      <para>
        The log message comprises a number of components:

          <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
          <term>2011-06-15 13:48:22.034</term>
<!-- TODO: timestamp repeated even if using syslog? -->
          <listitem><para>
              The date and time at which the message was generated.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>ERROR</term>
          <listitem><para>
              The severity of the message.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>[b10-resolver.asiolink]</term>
          <listitem><para>
            The source of the message.  This comprises two components:
            the BIND 10 process generating the message (in this
            case, <command>b10-resolver</command>) and the module
            within the program from which the message originated
            (which in the example is the asynchronous I/O link
            module, asiolink).
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>ASIODNS_OPENSOCK</term>
          <listitem><para>
            The message identification.  Every message in BIND 10
            has a unique identification, which can be used as an
            index into the <ulink
            url="bind10-messages.html"><citetitle>BIND 10 Messages
            Manual</citetitle></ulink> (<ulink
            url="http://bind10.isc.org/docs/bind10-messages.html"
            />) from which more information can be obtained.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>error 111 opening TCP socket to 127.0.0.1(53)</term>
          <listitem><para>
              A brief description of the cause of the problem.
              Within this text, information relating to the condition
              that caused the message to be logged will be included.
              In this example, error number 111 (an operating
              system-specific error number) was encountered when
              trying to open a TCP connection to port 53 on the
              local system (address 127.0.0.1).  The next step
              would be to find out the reason for the failure by
              consulting your system's documentation to identify
              what error number 111 means.

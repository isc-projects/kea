LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[doc] update to documentation.  This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix.  This is no different than a general bug fix
	except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause 
	security patch releases.

    <para>
      This document lists each message that can be logged by the
      programs in the BIND 10 package.  Each entry in this manual
      is of the form:
      <screen>IDENTIFICATION message-text</screen>
      ... where "IDENTIFICATION" is the message identification included
      in each message logged and "message-text" is the accompanying
      message text.  The "message-text" may include placeholders of the
      form "%1", "%2" etc.; these parameters are replaced by relevant
      values when the message is logged.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each entry is also accompanied by a description giving more
      information about the circumstances that result in the message
      being logged.

<varlistentry id="RESOLVER_SET_PARAMS">
<term>RESOLVER_SET_PARAMS query timeout: %1, client timeout: %2, lookup timeout: %3, retry count: %4</term>
<listitem><para>
This debug message lists the parameters being set for the resolver.  These are:
query timeout: the timeout (in ms) used for queries originated by the resolver
to upstream servers.  Client timeout: the interval to resolve a query by
a client: after this time, the resolver sends back a SERVFAIL to the client
whilst continuing to resolve the query. Lookup timeout: the time at which the
resolver gives up trying to resolve a query.  Retry count: the number of times
the resolver will retry a query to an upstream server if it gets a timeout.
</para><para>
The client and lookup timeouts require a bit more explanation. The
resolution of the client query might require a large number of queries to
upstream nameservers.  Even if none of these queries timeout, the total time
taken to perform all the queries may exceed the client timeout.  When this
happens, a SERVFAIL is returned to the client, but the resolver continues
with the resolution process; data received is added to the cache.  However,
there comes a time - the lookup timeout - when even the resolver gives up.
At this point it will wait for pending upstream queries to complete or
timeout and drop the query.

<term>XFRIN_AXFR_INCONSISTENT_SOA AXFR SOAs are inconsistent for %1: %2 expected, %3 received</term>
<listitem><para>
The serial fields of the first and last SOAs of AXFR (including AXFR-style
IXFR) are not the same.  According to RFC 5936 these two SOAs must be the
"same" (not only for the serial), but it is still not clear what the
receiver should do if this condition does not hold.  There was a discussion
about this at the IETF dnsext wg:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg07908.html
and the general feeling seems that it would be better to reject the
transfer if a mismatch is detected.  On the other hand, also as noted
in that email thread, neither BIND 9 nor NSD performs any comparison
on the SOAs.  For now, we only check the serials (ignoring other fields)
and only leave a warning log message when a mismatch is found.  If it
turns out to happen with a real world primary server implementation
and that server actually feeds broken data (e.g. mixed versions of
zone), we can consider a stricter action.

The first SOA record in an IXFR response indicates the zone's serial

basically unexpected event because normally the client first checks
the SOA serial by an SOA query, but can still happen if the transfer
is manually invoked or (although unlikely) there is a rapid change at
the primary server between the SOA and IXFR queries.  The client
implementation confirms the whole response is this single SOA, and
aborts the transfer just like a successful case.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be

secondary DNS server first tries to perform AXFR from a primary server
without creating the zone image beforehand (e.g. by b10-loadzone).  As
of this writing the xfrin process provides backward compatible
behavior to previous versions: creating a new one in the data source
not to surprise existing users too much.  This is probably not a good
idea, however, in terms of who should be responsible for managing
zones at a higher level.  In future it is more likely that a separate
zone management framework is provided, and the situation where the
given zone isn't found in xfrout will be treated as an error.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be

accidentally configured especially in a data source using "non

means subsequent AXFR can succeed and possibly replace the zone with

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred does not have an SOA RR in the data source.  This is not
necessarily an error; if a secondary DNS server first tries to perform

doesn't have an SOA.  Subsequent AXFR will fill in the zone; if the
attempt is IXFR it will fail in query creation.

The response to an SOA query prior to xfr indicated that the zone's
SOA serial at the primary server is smaller than that of the xfrin
client.  This is not necessarily an error especially if that
particular primary server is another secondary server which hasn't got
the latest version of the zone.  But if the primary server is known to
be the real source of the zone, some unexpected inconsistency may have
happened, and you may want to take a closer look.  In this case xfrin
doesn't perform subsequent zone transfer.

<term>XFROUT_QUERY_QUOTA_EXCCEEDED %1 client %2: request denied due to quota (%3)</term>
<listitem><para>
The xfr request was rejected because the server was already handling
the maximum number of allowable transfers as specified in the transfers_out
configuration parameter, which is also shown in the log message.  The
request was immediately responded and terminated with an RCODE of REFUSED.
This can happen for a busy xfrout server, and you may want to increase
this parameter; if the server is being too busy due to requests from
unexpected clients you may want to restrict the legitimate clients
with ACL.

There was an error receiving the file descriptor for the transfer

dnl @synopsis AX_BOOST_FOR_BIND10
dnl
dnl Test for the Boost C++ header files intended to be used within BIND 10
dnl
dnl If no path to the installed boost header files is given via the
dnl --with-boost-include option,  the macro searchs under
dnl /usr/local /usr/pkg /opt /opt/local directories.
dnl If it cannot detect any workable path for Boost, this macro treats it
dnl as a fatal error (so it cannot be called if the availability of Boost
dnl is optional).
dnl
dnl This macro also tries to identify some known portability issues, and
dnl sets corresponding variables so the caller can react to (or ignore,
dnl depending on other configuration) specific issues appropriately.
dnl
dnl This macro calls:
dnl
dnl   AC_SUBST(BOOST_INCLUDES)
dnl
dnl And possibly sets:
dnl   CPPFLAGS_BOOST_THREADCONF should be added to CPPFLAGS by caller
dnl   BOOST_OFFSET_PTR_WOULDFAIL set to yes if offset_ptr would cause build
dnl                              error; otherwise set to no

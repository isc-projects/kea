``kea-dhcp-ddns`` - DHCP-DDNS process in Kea
--------------------------------------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

:program:`kea-dhcp-ddns` [**-v**] [**-V**] [**-W**] [**-d**] [**-c** config-file] [**-t** config-file]

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``kea-dhcp-ddns`` service process requests an update of DNS mapping
based on DHCP lease-change events. It runs as a separate process that
expects to receive Name Change Requests from Kea DHCP servers.

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

The arguments are as follows:

``-v``
   Displays the Kea version.

``-V``
   Displays the extended Kea version.

``-W``
   Displays the configuration report.

``-d``
   Sets the logging level to debug with extra verbosity. This is primarily for
   development purposes in stand-alone mode.

``-c config-file``
   Specifies the configuration file with the configuration for the DHCP-DDNS server. It
   may also contain configuration entries for other Kea services.

``-t config-file``
   Checks the syntax of the configuration file and reports the first error,
   if any. Note that not all parameters are completely checked; in
   particular, a service socket is not opened.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kea comes with an extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers
all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installation,
configuration, configuration examples, and much more. Kea also features a
Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print
with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
https://kea.readthedocs.io.

Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide,
available at https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/.

The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

Mailing Lists and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two public mailing lists available for the Kea project. **kea-users**
(kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while **kea-dev**
(kea-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea developers, prospective
contributors, and other advanced users. Both lists are available at
https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort support
on both of those lists.

ISC provides professional support for Kea services. See
https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

History
~~~~~~~

The ``b10-dhcp-ddns`` process was first coded in May 2013 by Thomas
Markwalder.

Kea became a standalone server and the BIND 10 framework was removed. The
DHCP-DDNS server binary was renamed to kea-dhcp-ddns in July 2014. Kea
1.0.0 was released in December 2015.

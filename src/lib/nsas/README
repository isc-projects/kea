For an overview of the Nameserver Address Store, see the requirements and design
documents at http://bind10.isc.org/wiki/Resolver.

At the time of writing (19 October 2010), the file asiolink.h is present in this
directory only for the purposes of development.  When the resolver's
asynchronous I/O code has been finished, this will be removed and the NSAS will
use the "real" code.

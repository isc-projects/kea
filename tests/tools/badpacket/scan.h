    /// the fields in the flags word of the DNS message are held at adjacent

    /// of contiguous index values.

    /// the command line, it loops through those values and sets the appropriate
    /// value in the a copy of the DNS message header flags.  It then calls
    /// itself with an incremented index.  If the value was not given, it just
    /// sets a default value calls itself (with the incremented index).  When
    /// called with an index above the maximum valid index, the header flags
    /// in the message buffer are set and the next stage of processing called.

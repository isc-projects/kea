% ZONEMGR_CCSESSION_ERROR command channel session error: %1
An error was encountered on the command channel.  The message indicates
the nature of the error.

% ZONEMGR_DATASRC_CONFIG_ERROR failed to update data source configuration: %1
Configuration for the global data sources is updated, but the update
cannot be applied to zonemgr.  The zonemgr module will still keep running
with the previous configuration, but the cause of the failure and
other log messages must be carefully examined because if only zonemgr
rejects the new configuration then the entire BIND 10 system will have
inconsistent state among different modules.  If other modules accept
the update but zonemgr produces this error, the zonemgr module should
probably be restarted.

% ZONEMGR_JITTER_TOO_BIG refresh_jitter is too big, setting to 0.5
The value specified in the configuration for the refresh jitter is too large
so its value has been set to the maximum of 0.5.

% ZONEMGR_KEYBOARD_INTERRUPT exiting zonemgr process as result of keyboard interrupt
An informational message output when the zone manager was being run at a
terminal and it was terminated via a keyboard interrupt signal.

% ZONEMGR_LOAD_ZONE loading zone %1 (class %2)
This is a debug message indicating that the zone of the specified class
is being loaded.

% ZONEMGR_NO_MASTER_ADDRESS internal BIND 10 command did not contain address of master
A command received by the zone manager from the Auth module did not
contain the address of the master server from which a NOTIFY message
was received.  This may be due to an internal programming error; please
submit a bug report.

% ZONEMGR_NO_SOA zone %1 (class %2) does not have an SOA record
When loading the named zone of the specified class the zone manager
discovered that the data did not contain an SOA record.  The load has
been abandoned.

% ZONEMGR_NO_TIMER_THREAD trying to stop zone timer thread but it is not running
An attempt was made to stop the timer thread (used to track when zones
should be refreshed) but it was not running.  This may indicate an
internal program error.  Please submit a bug report.

% ZONEMGR_NO_ZONE_CLASS internal BIND 10 command did not contain class of zone
A command received by the zone manager from another BIND 10 module did
not contain the class of the zone on which the zone manager should act.
This may be due to an internal programming error; please submit a
bug report.

% ZONEMGR_NO_ZONE_NAME internal BIND 10 command did not contain name of zone
A command received by the zone manager from another BIND 10 module did
not contain the name of the zone on which the zone manager should act.
This may be due to an internal programming error; please submit a
bug report.

% ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_NOTIFY received NOTIFY command for zone %1 (class %2)
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received a
NOTIFY command over the command channel.  The command is sent by the Auth
process when it is acting as a slave server for the zone and causes the
zone manager to record the master server for the zone and start a timer;
when the timer expires, the master will be polled to see if it contains
new data.

% ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_SHUTDOWN received SHUTDOWN command
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
a SHUTDOWN command over the command channel from the Init process.
It will act on this command and shut down.

% ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_UNKNOWN received unknown command '%1'
This is a warning message indicating that the zone manager has received
the stated command over the command channel.  The command is not known
to the zone manager and although the command is ignored, its receipt
may indicate an internal error.  Please submit a bug report.

% ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_FAILED received XFRIN FAILED command for zone %1 (class %2)
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
an XFRIN FAILED command over the command channel.  The command is sent
by the Xfrin process when a transfer of zone data into the system has
failed, and causes the zone manager to schedule another transfer attempt.

% ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_SUCCESS received XFRIN SUCCESS command for zone %1 (class %2)
This is a debug message indicating that the zone manager has received
an XFRIN SUCCESS command over the command channel.  The command is sent
by the Xfrin process when the transfer of zone data into the system has
succeeded, and causes the data to be loaded and served by BIND 10.

% ZONEMGR_REFRESH_ZONE refreshing zone %1 (class %2)
The zone manager is refreshing the named zone of the specified class
with updated information.

% ZONEMGR_SELECT_ERROR error with select(): %1
An attempt to wait for input from a socket failed.  The failing operation
is a call to the operating system's select() function, which failed for
the given reason.

% ZONEMGR_SEND_FAIL failed to send command to %1, session has been closed
The zone manager attempted to send a command to the named BIND 10 module,
but the send failed.  The session between the modules has been closed.

% ZONEMGR_SESSION_ERROR unable to establish session to command channel daemon
The zonemgr process was not able to be started because it could not
connect to the command channel daemon.  The most usual cause of this
problem is that the daemon is not running.

% ZONEMGR_SESSION_TIMEOUT timeout on session to command channel daemon
The zonemgr process was not able to be started because it timed out when
connecting to the command channel daemon.  The most usual cause of this
problem is that the daemon is not running.

% ZONEMGR_SHUTDOWN zone manager has shut down
The zone manager has shut down completely.

% ZONEMGR_STARTED zonemgr started
This informational message is output by zonemgr when all initialization
has been completed and it is entering its main loop.

% ZONEMGR_STARTING zone manager starting
A debug message output when the zone manager starts up.

% ZONEMGR_TIMER_THREAD_RUNNING trying to start timer thread but one is already running
This message is issued when an attempt is made to start the timer
thread (which keeps track of when zones need a refresh) but one is
already running.  It indicates either an error in the program logic or
a problem with stopping a previous instance of the timer.  Please submit
a bug report.

% ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_FAIL zone %1 (class %2) is not known to the zone manager
An XFRIN operation has failed but the zone that was the subject of the
operation is not being managed by the zone manager. This can be either the
result of a bindctl command to transfer in a currently unknown (or mistyped)
zone, or, if this error appears without the administrator giving transfer
commands, it can indicate an error in the program, as it should not have
initiated transfers of unknown zones on its own.

% ZONEMGR_UNKNOWN_ZONE_SUCCESS zone %1 (class %2) is not known to the zone manager
An XFRIN operation has succeeded but the zone received is not being
managed by the zone manager.  This may indicate an error in the program
(as the operation should not have been initiated if this were the case).
Please submit a bug report.

% ZONEMGR_ZONE_NOTIFY_NOT_SECONDARY notify for zone %1/%2 from %3 received but not in secondaries
A NOTIFY was received but the zone is not listed in the configured
secondary zones of the zone manager.  The most common reason for this
is that it's simply received by a primary server of the zone.  Another
possibility is a configuration error that it's not configured as a
secondary while it should be.  In either case, the zone manager does
not take action in terms of zone management, and the authoritative
server will respond to it like in the secondary case.  If this is a
configuration error, it will be noticed by the fact that the zone
isn't updated even after a change is made in the primary server.

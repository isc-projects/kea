/// @brief Abstract packet handling class for DHCPv6.
///
/// This class defines methods for performing low level operations on IPv6
/// socket:
/// - open socket,
/// - send DHCPv6 message through the socket,
/// - receive DHCPv6 through the socket.
///
/// Methods exposed by this class are called through the @c IfaceMgr only. They
/// are not meant to be called directly, except unit testing.
///
/// The @c IfaceMgr is responsible for managing the pool of sockets. In
/// particular, @c IfaceMgr detects interfaces suitable to send/receive DHCPv6
/// messages. When it intends to open a socket on a particular interface, it
/// will call the PktFilter6::openSocket. If this call is successful, the
/// structure describing a new socket is returned.
///
/// In order to send or receive a DHCPv6 message through this socket,
/// the @c IfaceMgr must use PktFilter6::send or PktFilter6::receive
/// functions of the same class that has been used to open a socket,
/// i.e. all send/receive operations should be performed using this
/// particular class.
///
/// The major motivation behind creating a separate class, to manage low level
/// operations using sockets, is to make @c IfaceMgr unit testable. By providing
/// a stub implementation of this class which mimics the behavior of the real
/// socket handling class, it is possible to simulate and test various
/// conditions. For example, the @c IfaceMgr::openSockets function will try to
/// open sockets on all available interfaces. The test doesn't have any means
/// to know which interfaces are present. In addition, even if the network
/// interface detection was implemented on the test side, there is no guarantee
/// that the particular system has sufficient number of suitable IPv6-enabled
/// interfaces available for a particular test. Moreover, the test may need
/// to tweak some of the interface configuration to cover certain test
/// scenarios. The proposed solution is to not use the actual interfaces
/// but simply create a pool of fake interfaces which configuration
/// can be freely modified by a test. This however implies that operations
/// on sockets must be simulated.
///
/// @note This class is named after @c PktFilter abstract class which exposes
/// similar interface for DHVPv4. However, the PktFilter class is devoted to
/// solve the problem of sending DHCPv4 messages to the hosts which don't have
/// an IP address yet (a.k.a. direct DHCPv4 traffic). Where required, the
/// custom implementations of @c PktFilter are provided to send and receive
/// messages through raw sockets. In order to filter out the desired traffic
/// Linux Packet Filtering or Berkeley Packet Filtering is used, hence the
/// name of the class. In case of DHCPv6 regular IPv6/UDPv6 sockets are used
/// and derived classes do not use Linux or Berkeley Packet Filtering.

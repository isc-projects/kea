/// \namespace asio_link
/// \brief A wrapper interface for the ASIO library.
///
/// The \c asio_link namespace is used to define a set of wrapper interfaces
/// for the ASIO library.
///
/// BIND 10 uses the non-Boost version of ASIO because it's header-only,
/// i.e., does not require a separate library object to be linked, and thus
/// lowers the bar for introduction.
///
/// But the advantage comes with its own costs: since the header-only version
/// includes more definitions in public header files, it tends to trigger
/// more compiler warnings for our own sources, and, depending on the
/// compiler options, may make the build fail.
///
/// We also found it may be tricky to use ASIO and standard C++ libraries
/// in a single translation unit, i.e., a .cc file: depending on the order
/// of including header files, ASIO may or may not work on some platforms.
///
/// This wrapper interface is intended to centralize these
/// problematic issues in a single sub module.  Other BIND 10 modules should
/// simply include \c asio_link.h and use the wrapper API instead of
/// including ASIO header files and using ASIO-specific classes directly.
///
/// This wrapper may be used for other IO libraries if and when we want to
/// switch, but generality for that purpose is not the primary goal of
/// this module.  The resulting interfaces are thus straightforward mapping
/// to the ASIO counterparts.
///
/// Notes to developers:
/// Currently the wrapper interface is specific to the authoritative
/// server implementation.  But the plan is to generalize it and have
/// other modules use it.
///
/// One obvious drawback of this approach is performance overhead
/// due to the additional layer.  We should eventually evaluate the cost
/// of the wrapper abstraction in benchmark tests. Another drawback is
/// that the wrapper interfaces don't provide all features of ASIO
/// (at least for the moment).  We should also re-evaluate the
/// maintenance overhead of providing necessary wrappers as we develop
/// more.
///
/// On the other hand, we may be able to exploit the wrapper approach to
/// simplify the interfaces (by limiting the usage) and unify performance
/// optimization points.
///
/// As for optimization, we may want to provide a custom allocator for
/// the placeholder of callback handlers:
/// http://think-async.com/Asio/asio-1.3.1/doc/asio/reference/asio_handler_allocate.html

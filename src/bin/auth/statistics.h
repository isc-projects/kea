/// \brief Set of query counters.
///
/// \c AuthCounters is set of query counters class. It holds query counters
/// and provides an interface to increment the counter of specified type
/// (e.g. UDP query, TCP query).
///
/// This class also provides a function to send statistics information to
/// statistics module.
///
/// This class is designed to be a part of \c AuthSrv.
/// Call \c setStatisticsSession() to set a session to communicate with
/// statistics module like Xfrin session.
/// Call \c inc() to increment a counter for specific type of query in
/// the query processing function. use \c enum \c QueryType to specify
/// the type of query.
/// Call \c submitStatistics() to submit statistics information to statistics
/// module with statistics_session, periodically or at a time the command
/// \c sendstats is received.
///
/// We may eventually want to change the structure to hold values that is
/// not counters (such as concurrent TCP connections), or seperate generic
/// part to src/lib to share with the other modules.
///
/// This class uses pimpl idiom and hides detailed implementation.
/// This class is constructed on startup of the server, so
/// construction overhead of this approach should be acceptable.
///
/// \todo Hold counters for each query types (Notify, Axfr, Ixfr, Normal)
/// \todo Consider overhead of \c AuthCounters::inc()

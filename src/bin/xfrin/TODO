1. When xfrin's config data is changed, new config data should be applied.
2. mutex on recorder is not sufficient.  race can happen if two xfrin requests
   occur at the same time.  (but testing it would be very difficult)
3. It wouldn't support IPv6 because of the following line:
        self.create_socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   [FIXED in r1851]
4. Xfrin.retransfer and refresh share most of the code.  should be unified.
   [FIXED in r1861]
5. class IN is hardcoded.  bad.
        query_question = question(name(self._zone_name), rr_class.IN(), query_type)
   [FIXED in r1889]
   Note: we still hardcode it as the fixed default value for
   retransfer/refresh commands.
   we should fix this so that this is specifiable, so this TODO item is 
   still open.
6. QID 0 should be allowed:
        query_id = random.randint(1, 0xFFFF)
   [FIXED in r1880]
7. what if xfrin fails after opening a new DB?  looks like garbage
   (intermediate) data remains in the DB file, although it's more about
   the data source implementation.  check it, and fix it if it's the case.
8. Xfrin.command_handler() ignores unknown commands.  should return an error.
   [FIXED in r1882]
9. XfrinConnection can leak sockets. (same problem as that Jelte mentioned
   on xfrout?)
   [FIXED in r1908]
10. The following line of _check_soa_serial() is incorrect.
        soa_reply = self._get_request_response(int(data_size))
    Unpack the data and convert it in the host by order.
    [FIXED in r1866]
11. if do_xfrin fails it should probably return a non "OK" value.
    (it's currently ignored anyway, though)
    [FIXED in r1887]
12. XfrinConnection should probably define handle_close().  Also, the
    following part should be revised because this can also happen when the
    master closes the connection.
            if self._recv_time_out:
                raise XfrinException('receive data from socket time out.')
13. according to the source code xfrin cannot quickly terminate on shutdown
    if some of the xfr connections stall.  on a related note, the use of
    threading.Event() is questionable: since no threads wait() on the event,
    it actually just works as a global flag shared by all threads.
    this implementation should be refactored so that a shutdown command is
    propagate to all threads immediately, whether it's via a builtin mechanism
    of the threading module or not (it's probably "not", see below).
14. the current use of asyncore seems to be thread unsafe because it
    relies on a global channel map (which is the implicit default).
    each thread should probably use its own map:
      asyncore.dispatcher.__init__(self, map=sock_map)
      # where sock_map is thread specific and is passed to
      # XfrinConnection.__init__().
15. but in the first place, it's not clear why we need asyncore.
    since each thread is responsible for a single xfr connection,
    socket operations can safely block (with timeouts).  this should
    be easily implemented using the bear socket module, and the code
    would look like more straightforward by avoiding complicated logic
    for asynchrony.  in fact, that simplicity should be a major
    advantage with thread over event-driven (the model asyncore
    implements), so this mixture of two models seems awkward to me.
16. having said all that, asyncore may still be necessary to address
    item #13: we'd need an explicit communication channel (e.g. a
    pipe) between the parent thread and xfr connection thread, through
    which a shutdown notification would be sent to the child.  With
    this approach each thread needs to watch at least two channels,
    and then it would need some asynchronous communication mechanism.
17. Do zone transfer from notifyfrom address first, if it's one master of the zone.
18. Check soa serial first when doing zone refreshment.

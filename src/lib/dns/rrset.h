/// \brief The \c AbstractRRset class is an abstract base class that
/// models a DNS RRset.
///
/// An object of (a specific derived class of) \c AbstractRRset
/// models an RRset as described in the DNS standard:
/// A set of DNS resource records (RRs) of the same type and class.
/// The standard requires the TTL of all RRs in an RRset be the same;
/// this class follows that requirement.

/// Note about duplicate RDATA: RFC2181 states that it's meaningless that an
/// RRset contains two identical RRs and that name servers should suppress
/// such duplicates.
/// This class is not responsible for ensuring this requirement: For example,
/// \c addRdata() method doesn't check if there's already RDATA identical
/// to the one being added.
/// This is because such checks can be expensive, and it's often easy to
/// ensure the uniqueness requirement at the %data preparation phase
/// (e.g. when loading a zone).
/// When parsing an incoming DNS message, the uniqueness may not be guaranteed,
/// so the application needs to detect and ignore any duplicate RDATA
/// (the \c Message class of this library should provide this responsibility).
///
/// Another point to note is that \c AbstractRRset and its derived classes
/// allow an object to have an empty set of RDATA.
/// Even though there's no corresponding notion in the protocol specification,
/// it would be more intuitive for a container-like %data structure
/// to allow an empty set.
///
/// Since \c AbstractRRset is an abstract class, it is generally used
/// via a pointer (or pointer like object) or a reference.
/// In particular, \c RRsetPtr, a pointer like type for \c AbstractRRset,
/// is used for polymorphic RRset operations throughout this library.
///
/// The \c AbstractRRset class is also intended to be a major customization
/// point.  For example, a high performance server implementation may want
/// to define an optimized "pre-compiled" RRset and provide an optimized
/// implementation of the \c toWire() method.
///
/// Note about design choice: In BIND9, a set of RDATA with a common tuple
/// of RR class, RR type, and TTL was represented in a structure named
/// \c rdataset.  Unlike the RRset classes, an \c rdataset did not contain
/// the information of the owner name.
/// This might be advantageous if we want to handle "RRsets", that is,
/// a set of different types of RRset for the same owner name, because
/// a single "name" structure can be used for multiple RRsets, minimizing
/// %data copy and memory footprint.
/// On the other hand, it's inconvenient for API users since in many cases
/// a pair of name and an \c rdataset must be maintained.  It's also counter
/// intuitive in implementing protocol operations as an RRset is often used
/// as an atomic entity in DNS protocols while an \c rdataset is a component
/// of an RRset.
///
/// We have therefore defined the notion of RRset explicitly in our initial
/// API design.  We believe memory footprint is not a big concern because
/// RRsets are generally expected to be used as temporary objects, e.g.
/// while parsing or constructing a DNS message, or searching a DNS %data
/// source; for longer term purposes such as in-memory %data source entries,
/// the corresponding %data would be represented in a different, memory
/// optimized format.  As for the concern about %data copy, we believe
/// it can be mitigated by using copy-efficient implementation for the
/// \c Name class implementation, such as reference counted objects.
/// Later, We plan to perform benchmark tests later to see if this assumption
/// is valid and to revisit the design if necessary.
///
/// Note about terminology: there has been a discussion at the IETF
/// namedroppers ML about RRset vs RRSet (case of "s")
/// [http://ops.ietf.org/lists/namedroppers/namedroppers.2009/msg02737.html].
/// While RFC2181 uses the latter, many other RFCs use the former,
/// and most of the list members who showed their opinion seem to prefer
/// "RRset".  We follow that preference in this implementation.
///
/// The current design of \c AbstractRRset is still in flux.
/// There are many open questions in design details:
///   - support more set-like operations, e.g, merge two RRsets of the same
///     type?
///   - more convenient methods or non member utility functions, e.g.
///      "sort" and "search(find)" method?
///   - what about comparing two RRsets of the same type?  If we need this,
///     should it compare rdata's as a set or as a list (i.e. compare
///     each rdata one by one or as a whole)?  c.f. NLnet Labs' ldns
///     (http://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/doc/index.html)
///     has \c ldns_rr_list_compare(), which takes the latter approach
///     (seemingly assuming the caller sorts the lists beforehand).
///   - BIND9 libdns has some special DNSSEC-related methods
///     such as \c addnoqname() or \c addclosest().  Do we need these?
///     (Probably not.  We wouldn't want to make the class design too
///     monolithic.)
///   - Do we need to allow the user to remove specific Rdata?
///     Probably not, according to the current usage of the BIND9 code.

/// \brief TSIG key.
///
/// This class holds a TSIG key along with some related attributes as
/// defined in RFC2845.
///
/// A TSIG key consists of the following attributes:
/// - Key name
/// - Hash algorithm
/// - Shared secret
///
/// <b>Implementation Notes</b>
///
/// We may add more attributes in future versions.  For example, if and when
/// we support the TKEY protocol (RFC2930), we may need to introduce the
/// notion of inception and expiration times.
/// At that point we may also have to introduce a class hierarchy to handle
/// different types of keys in a polymorphic way.
/// At the moment we use the straightforward value-type class with minimal
/// attributes.
///
/// In the TSIG protocol, hash algorithms are represented in the form of
/// domain name.
/// Our interfaces provide direct translation of this concept; for example,
/// the constructor from parameters take a \c Name object to specify the
/// algorithm.
/// On one hand, this may be counter intuitive.
/// An API user would rather specify "hmac-md5" instead of
/// <code>Name("hmac-md5.sig-alg.reg.int")</code>.
/// On the other hand, it may be more convenient for some kind of applications
/// if we maintain the algorithm as the expected representation for
/// protocol operations (such as sign and very a message).
/// Considering these points, we adopt the interface closer to the protocol
/// specification for now.
/// To minimize the burden for API users, we also define a set of constants
/// for commonly used algorithm names so that the users don't have to
/// remember the actual domain names defined in the protocol specification.
/// We may also have to add conversion routines between domain names
/// and more intuitive representations (e.g. strings) for algorithms.

    /// opaquely, e.g., when generating a response TSIG with a BADKEY error
    /// because the algorithm is unknown as specified in Section 3.2 of
    /// RFC2845 (in which case the algorithm name would be copied from the

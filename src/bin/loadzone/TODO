Add verbose option to show what it is adding, not necessarily
in master file format, but in the context of the data source.

Add "check" option to check sanity of master file but don't really
add to data source.

Currently b10-loadzone uses a default database path, overridable by
the -d option.  It should also be able to get the database path from
the bind10 configuration.

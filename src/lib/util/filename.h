/// \brief Class to Manipulate Filenames
///
/// This is a utility class to manipulate filenames.  It repeats some of the
/// features found in the Boost filename class, but is self-contained so avoids
/// the need to link in the Boost library.
///
/// A Unix-style filename comprises three parts:
///
/// Directory - everything up to and including the last "/".  If there is no
/// "/" in the string, there is no directory component.  Note that the
/// requirement of a trailing slash eliminates the ambiguity of whether a
/// component is a directory or not, e.g. in /alpha/beta", "beta" could be the
/// name of a directory or is could be a file.  The interpretation here is that
/// "beta" is the name of a file (although that file could be a directory).
///
/// Note: Under Windows, the drive letter is considered to be part of the
/// directory specification.  Unless this class becomes more widely-used on
/// Windows, there is no point in adding redundant code.
///
/// Name - everything from the character after the last "/" up to but not
/// including the last ".".
///
/// Extension - everything from the right-most "." (after the right-most "/") to
/// the end of the string.  If there is no "." after the last "/", there is
/// no file extension.
///
/// (Note that on Windows, this function will replace all "\" characters
/// with "/" characters on input strings.)
///
/// This class provides functions for extracting the components and for
/// substituting components.

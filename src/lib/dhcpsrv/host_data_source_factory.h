/// This class comprises nothing but static methods used to create a host data
/// source object. It analyzes the database information passed to the creation
/// function and instantiates an appropriate host data source object based on
/// the type requested.
///
/// Strictly speaking these functions could be stand-alone functions.  However,
/// it is convenient to encapsulate them in a class for naming purposes.

    /// Each database backend has its own host data source type. This static
    /// method sets the "current" host data source to be an object of the
    /// appropriate type.  The actual host data source is returned by the
    /// "instance" method.
    ///
    /// @note When called, the current host data source is <b>always</b> destroyed
    ///       and a new one created - even if the parameters are the same.
    ///
    /// dbaccess is a generic way of passing parameters. Parameters are passed
    /// in the "name=value" format, separated by spaces.  The data MUST include
    /// a keyword/value pair of the form "type=dbtype" giving the database
    /// type, e.q. "mysql" or "sqlite3".
    ///

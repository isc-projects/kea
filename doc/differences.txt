Differences of Bind 10 to other software
========================================

Bind 9
------

TODO: There are definitely more differences than just this.

* When an incoming zone transfer fails, for example because the
  received zone doesn't contain a NS record, bind 9 stops serving the
  zone and returns SERVFAIL to queries for that zone. Bind 10 still
  uses the previous version of zone.

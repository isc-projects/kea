add statics for RRClass::IN() (RRClass.IN()) etc.
(and replace RRClass("IN") in tests with those)

same for RRType? (xfrout.py.in line 256)

__str__ for name, question, everything with to_text()
rich compare for name (at least so we can have ==)

should Name.downcase() return a ref to itself?

All constructors based on buffers need an optional position
argument (like question_python has now)

at question.to_wire(bytes) does not seem to work right (only return
value seems correct, while i'd like in-place addition if possible)

creating a render message and not setting opcode/rcode results in a segfault later (nullpointer)


The function set wrapped is not complete; for instance, in
MessageRenderer, we really only provide the high-level readout
functions. Do we need access to the writers? (there is one set() right
now).

All constants are now added named in the base module, while they should
be added as class constants. Dunno how though.


segfault when comparing with bad type like int (at least for Name and Rcode, but probably for the rest too)

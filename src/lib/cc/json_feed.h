/// @brief State model for asynchronous read of data in JSON format.
///
/// Kea control channel uses stream sockets for forwarding commands received
/// by the Kea Control Agent to respective Kea services. The responses may
/// contain large amounts of data (e.g. lease queries may return thousands
/// of leases). Such responses rarely fit into a single data buffer and
/// require multiple calls to receive/read or asynchronous receive/read.
///
/// A receiver performing multiple reads from a socket must be able to
/// locate the boundaries of the command within the data stream. The
/// @ref JSONFeed state model solves this problem.
///
/// When the partial data is read from the stream socket it should be provided
/// to the @ref JSONFeed using @ref JSONFeed::postBuffer and then the
/// @ref JSONFeed::poll should be called to start processing the received
/// data. The actual JSON structure can be preceded by whitespaces. When first
/// occurrence of one of the '{' or '[' characters is found in the stream it is
/// considered a beginning of the JSON structure. The model includes an internal
/// counter of new '{' and '[' occurrences. The counter increases one of these
/// characters is found. When any of the '}' or ']' is found, the counter
/// is decreased. When the counter is decreased to 0 it indicates that the
/// entire JSON structure has been received and processed.
///
/// As '{', '}', '[' and ']' can be embedded in JSON strings two states
/// for strings and escape in strings are required. Note the processing
/// of escapes is greatly simplified compared to ECMA 404 figure 5.

/// Note that this mechanism doesn't check if the JSON structure is well
/// formed. It merely detects the end of the JSON structure if this structure
/// is well formed. The structure is validated when @ref JSONFeed::toElement
/// is called to retrieve the data structures encapsulated with
/// @ref isc::data::Element objects.

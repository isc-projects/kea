Feature: Example feature
    This is an example Feature set. Is is mainly intended to show
    our use of the lettuce tool and our own framework for it
    The first scenario is to show what a simple test would look like, and
    is intentionally uncommented.
    The later scenarios have comments to show what the test steps do and
    support

    Scenario: A simple example
        Given I have bind10 running with configuration example.org.config
        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
        And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED

        bind10 module Auth should be running
        And bind10 module Resolver should not be running
        And bind10 module Xfrout should not be running
        And bind10 module Zonemgr should not be running
        And bind10 module Xfrin should not be running
        And bind10 module Stats should not be running
        And bind10 module StatsHttpd should not be running

        A query for www.example.org should have rcode NOERROR
        A query for www.doesnotexist.org should have rcode REFUSED
        The SOA serial for example.org should be 1234

    Scenario: New database
        # This test checks whether a database file is automatically created
        # Underwater, we take advantage of our initialization routines so
        # that we are sure this file does not exist, see
        # features/terrain/terrain.py

        # Standard check to test (non-)existence of a file.
        # This file is actually automatically created.
        The file data/test_nonexistent_db.sqlite3 should not exist

        # In the first scenario, we used 'given I have bind10 running', which
        # is actually a compound step consisting of the following two
        # one to start the server
        When I start bind10 with configuration no_db_file.config

        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
        And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED

        # Now we use the first step again to see if the file has been created
        The file data/test_nonexistent_db.sqlite3 should exist

        bind10 module Auth should be running
        And bind10 module Resolver should not be running
        And bind10 module Xfrout should not be running
        And bind10 module Zonemgr should not be running
        And bind10 module Xfrin should not be running
        And bind10 module Stats should not be running
        And bind10 module StatsHttpd should not be running

        # This is a general step to stop a named process. By convention,
        # the default name for any process is the same as the one we
        # use in the start step (for bind 10, that is 'I start bind10 with')
        # See scenario 'Multiple instances' for more.
        Then stop process bind10

    Scenario: example.org queries
        # This scenario performs a number of queries and inspects the results
        # Simple queries have already been show, but after we have sent a query,
        # we can also do more extensive checks on the result.
        # See querying.py for more information on these steps.

        # note: lettuce can group similar checks by using tables, but we
        # intentionally do not make use of that here

        # This is a compound statement that starts and waits for the
        # started message
        Given I have bind10 running with configuration example.org.config
        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
        And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED

    Scenario: changing database

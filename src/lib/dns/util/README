This "util" directory is provided for utility header files and
implementations that are internally used in the DNS library
(libdns++).

The header files in this directory are not intended to be installed.
Likewise, classes and public functions defined in this directory are
not intended to be used outside libdns++, although we cannot prohibit
it at the language level.

They are not even expected to be used in other modules of BIND 10 than
libdns++.  Although there seem to be some violations as of this
writing, we should eventually fix it.

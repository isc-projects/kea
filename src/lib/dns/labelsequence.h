/// without needing to copy the underlying data on each label strip.
///
/// It can only work on existing Name objects, and the Name object MUST
/// remain in scope during the entire lifetime of its associated
/// LabelSequence(s).
///
/// Upon creation of a LabelSequence, it records the offsets of the
/// labels in the wireformat data of the Name. When stripLeft() or
/// stripRight() is called on the LabelSequence, no changes in the
/// Name's data occur, but the internal pointers of the
/// LabelSequence are modified.
///
/// LabelSequences can be compared to other LabelSequences, and their
/// data can be requested (which then points to part of the original
/// data of the associated Name object).

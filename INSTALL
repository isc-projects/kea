If using git (not the tarball), build the "configure" file:
    autoreconf --install

To then build from source:
    ./configure
    make

Kea depends on C++ compiler, make, libtool, boost (at least includes, but many
OSes require boost-system library), log4cplus and one crypto library (either
OpenSSL or Botan) for compilation.  Optional backends (MySQL, PostgreSQL and
Cassandra) have additional dependencies. For detailed installation directions,
see the guide at doc/guide/kea-guide.txt or doc/guide/kea-guide.html.

You can find user-contributed OS-specific build/installation
instructions on the Kea wiki: http://kea.isc.org/wiki/Install

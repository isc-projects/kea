    /// more frequently than the latter one and it is based on the

    /// dropped by the server or may be sent out of order and we still

    /// hashing transaction ids using custom function \ref hashTransid.
    /// Note that other possibility would be to simply specify index
    /// that uses transaction id directly (instead of hashing with
    /// \ref hashTransid). In this case however we have chosen to use
    /// hashing function because it shortens the index size to just
    /// 1023 values maximum. Search operation on this index generally
    /// returns the range of packets that have the same transaction id
    /// hash assigned but most often these ranges will be short so further
    /// search within a range to find a packet with particular transaction
    /// id will not be intensive.
    ///

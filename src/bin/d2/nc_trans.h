/// @brief Embodies the "life-cycle" required to carry out a DDNS update.
///
/// NameChangeTransaction is the base class that provides the common state
/// model mechanics and services performing the DNS updates needed to carry out
/// a DHCP_DDNS request as described by a NameChangeRequest.  It is derived
/// from StateModel which supplies a simple, general purpose FSM implementation.
///
/// Upon construction, each transaction has all of the information and
/// resources required to carry out its assigned request, including the list(s)
/// of DNS server(s) needed. It is responsible for knowing what conversations
/// it must have with which servers and in the order necessary to fulfill the
/// request. Upon fulfillment of the request, the transaction's work is complete
/// and it is destroyed.
///
/// Fulfillment of the request is carried out through the performance of the
/// transaction's state model.  Using a state driven implementation accounts
/// for the conditional processing flow necessary to meet the DDNS RFCs as well
/// as the asynchronous nature of IO with DNS servers.
///
/// Derivations of the class are responsible for defining the state model and
/// conversations necessary to carry out the specific of request.
///
/// Conversations with DNS servers are done through the use of the DNSClient
/// class.  The DNSClient provides a IOService-based means a service which
/// performs a single, packet exchange with a given DNS server.  It sends a
/// single update to the server and returns the response, asynchronously,
/// through a callback.  At each point in a transaction's state model, where
/// an update is to be sent, the model "suspends" until notified by the
/// DNSClient via the callbacka.  Suspension is done by posting a
/// StateModel::NOP_EVT as the next event, stopping the state model execution.
///
/// Resuming state model execution when a DNS update completes is done by a
/// call to StateModel::runStateModel() from within the DNSClient callback,
/// with an event value of IO_COMPLETED_EVT (described below).
///
/// This class defines a set of events and states that are a common to all
/// transactions. Each derivation may add define additional states and events
/// as needed, but it must support the common set.  NameChangeTransaction
/// does not supply any state handlers.  These are the sole responsibility of
/// derivations.

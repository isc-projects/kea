/// to a new file on a daily basis.  The physical file name(s) are
/// determined as follows:
///
/// Forms the current file name from:
///
///    "<path>/<base_name>.<date>.txt"
///
/// where:
/// - @b path - is the pathname supplied via the constructor. The path
/// must exist and be writable by the process
///
/// - @b base_name - an arbitrary text label supplied via the constructor
///
/// - @b date - is the system date, at the time the file is opened, in local
/// time.  The format of the value is CCYYMMDD (century,year,month,day) or
/// TXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX is the time in seconds since
/// epoch)
///
/// Prior to each write, the system date is compared to the current file date
/// to determine if rotation is necessary (i.e. day boundary has been crossed
/// since the last write).  If so, the current file is closed, and the new
/// file is created.
///
/// Content is added to the file by passing the desired line text into
/// the method, writeln().  This method prepends the content  with the current
/// date and time and appends an EOL.
///
/// The class implements virtual methods in facilitate unit testing
/// and derives from @c LegalLogMgr abstract class.

 * this base class. This will allow us to define new types of checks without
 * changing any of the code that is using it and with the correct
 * implementation even without changing the thing that parses configuration
 * and creates instances of the checks.
 *
 * It is implemented as a template. This allows easy reuse of the code for
 * checking of different types of things (packets of different protocols, etc).
 * We'll implement the loader and compound checks as templates as well (
 * and just make sure they are instantiated for each type of thing we want
 * to check). While most of concrete checks will be specific for one protocol
 * (or whatever the entity we check is), it makes sense to implement some of
 * these as templates as well (for example the IP address check, for whatever
 * context that contains member called ip and has the right methods).
 *
 * The Context carries whatever information might be checked for that protocol
 * (eg. the packet, information where it came from, to what port, ...).

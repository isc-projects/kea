///
/// This class is actually a simple wrapper for a \c DomainTree whose data is
/// of \c ZoneData, and provides allocator, deallocator, and some basic
/// manipulation methods.
///
/// A single \c ZoneData object is intended to be used for a single specific
/// RR class, and provides a mapping from a name to a \c ZoneData (using the
/// best matching search semantics).  The \c ZoneData class itself does not
/// maintain the information of the RR class; the user of this class is
/// responsible for associating a specific RR class to a corresponding
/// \c ZoneData object.
///
/// This class is designed so an instance can be stored in a shared memory
/// region.  So it only contains straightforward data (e.g., it doesn't hold
/// a pointer to an object of some base class that contains virtual methods),
/// and some pointers (either as a direct or indirect member variable) are
/// represented as offset pointers.  For the same reason this class should
/// never has virtual methods (and as a result, should never be inherited
/// in practice).  When this class is extended these properties must be
/// retained.
///
/// This class is intended to be used as a backend for the \c MemoryDataSrc
/// class, and is not intended to be used for other general purposes.

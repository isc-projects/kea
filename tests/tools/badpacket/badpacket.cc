/// \brief Perform Bad Packet Scan
///
/// Scans the server by sending a sequence of (potentially) bad packets and
/// printing the packet settings and the response received.  The principle
/// raison d'etre for this is to check if a bad packet will cause a crash.
///
/// This particular version of the code allows a set of ranges to be set for:
/// - The flags fields in the message.
/// - The section count fields, regardless of what is in the section.
/// - The message size: the message can be truncated or extended.
///
/// The program then sends a set of packets corresponding to all combinations
/// of values in the ranges selected.

// TODO: Extend to cover:
// - Mangling the QNAME
// - Adding names to the message sections
// - Adding EDNS0 RR and magling the fields there

/// @brief Kea Control Agent Application Process
///
/// CtrlAgentProcess provides top level application logic for the Control
/// Agent, a process managing Kea servers.
///
/// The Control Agent receives JSON control commands over HTTP and forwards
/// the JSON commands to the respective Kea servers. The JSON command
/// includes a name of the server to which the command pertains. After
/// receiving a response from the Kea server it is sent back over HTTP
/// to the control API client.
///
/// Some commands are handled by the Control Agent process itself, rather than
/// forwarded to the Kea servers. An example of such command is the one that
/// instructs the agent to start a specific service.

    /// configuration integrity in case of errors. In this case, when the
    /// HTTP listener's configuration is modified there is a need to close all
    /// existing connections and gracefully shutdown the listener's instance.

    /// and/or port are syntactically correct.

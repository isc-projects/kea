	Added initial implementation of congestion handling to kea-dhcp4
	and kea-dhcpt6. This adds a new top level element to the server
	configurations, "dhcp-queue-control".  Both servers will now
	read client packets from interface sockets in a separate thread

	A new hooks library, Stat Cmds, has been added to the open source
	distribution.  This library provides commands for fetching lease
	allocation statistics using lease backend as the source for
	lease counts per state.  This resolves an issue in deployments,
	where multiple Kea servers share a common lease backend, which made
	it difficult to obtain accurate lease statistics.

	Kea servers share a common PostgreSQL lease database, which made
	it difficult to obtain accurate lease statistics. Since these statistics
	are now tracked by the database, they do not have to be recalculated at
	startup or following reconfiguration. This may result in less
	processing overhead during these events. The new statistics will be
	accessible via a new Hooks library, being developed for Kea 1.4

	DHCPv6 server avoids collisions between prefixes that are allocated
	as a result of receiving hints from the clients. Previously the

	Handled some rare error cases in DNS server classes correctly.
	This fix specifically solves occasional crash of b10-auth due to
	errors caused by TCP DNS clients.  Also, as a result of cleanups
	with the fix, b10-auth should now be a little bit faster in
	handling UDP queries: in some local experiments it ran about 5%
	faster.

	b10-cmdctl: fixed a hangup problem on receiving the shutdown
	command from bindctl.  Note, however, that cmdctl is defined as
	a "needed" module by default, so shutting down cmdctl would cause
	shutdown of the entire BIND 10 system anyway, and is therefore
	still not very useful in practice.

	Worked around some unit test regressions on FreeBSD 9.1 due to
	a binary compatibility issue between standard and system
	libraries (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=175453).
	While not all tests still pass, main BIND 10 programs should
	generally work correctly.  Still, there can be odd run time
	behavior such as abrupt crash instead of graceful shutdown
	when some fatal event happens, so it's generally discouraged to
	use BIND 10 on FreeBSD 9.1 RELEASE.  According to the above
	bug report for FreeBSD, it seems upgrading or downgrading the
	FreeBSD version will solve this problem.

	The "delete record" interface of the database based data source
	was extended so that the parameter includes reversed name in
	addition to the actual name.  This may help the underlying
	accessor implementation if reversed names are more convenient
	for the delete operation.  This was the case for the SQLite3
	accessor implementation, and it now performs delete operations
	much faster.  At a higher level, this means IXFR and DDNS Updates
	to the sqlite3 database are no longer so slow on large zones as

	The separate "static" data source is now deprecated as it can be
	served in the more generic "MasterFiles" type of data source.
	This means existing configuration may not work after an update.
	If "config show data_sources/classes/CH[0]" on bindctl contains a
	"static" type of data source, you'll need to update it as follows:
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/type MasterFiles
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/params {"BIND": =>
	  "<the value of current data_sources/classes/CH[0]/params>"}
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/cache-enable true
	> config commit
	(Same for CH[1], CH[2], IN[0], etc, if applicable, although it
	should be very unlikely in practice.  Also note: '=>' above
	indicates the next line is actually part of the command.  Do
	not type in this "arrow").

	b10-loadzone was fully overhauled.  It now uses C++-based zone
	parser and loader library, performing stricter checks, having
	more complete support for master file formats, producing more

	sources, and yet much faster than the old version.  In
	functionality the new version should be generally backwards
	compatible to the old version, but there are some
	incompatibilities: name fields of RDATA (in NS, SOA, etc) must
	be absolute for now; due to the stricter checks some input that was
	(incorrectly) accepted by the old version may now be rejected;
	command line options and arguments are not compatible.

	backward compatible to the previous one, but due to the
	tighter checks some input that has been accepted so far
	could now be rejected, so it's advisable to check if you
	use textual zone files directly loaded to memory.

	Fixed a problem that shutting down BIND 10 kept some of the
	processes alive.  It was two-fold: when the main bind10 process
	started as a root, started b10-sockcreator with the privilege, and
	then dropped the privilege, the bind10 process cannot kill the
	sockcreator via signal any more (when it has to), but it kept
	sending the signal and didn't stop.  Also, when running on Python
	3.1 (or older), the sockcreator had some additional file
	descriptor open, which prevented it from exiting even after the
	bind10 process terminated.  Now the bind10 process simply gives up
	killing a subprocess if it fails due to lack of permission, and it
	makes sure the socket creator is spawned without any unnecessary
	FDs open.

	Memory footprint of the in-memory data source has been
	substantially improved.  For example, b10-auth now requires much
	less memory than BIND 9 named for loading and serving the same
	zone in-memory.  This is a transparent change in terms of user
	operation; there's no need to update or change the configuration
	to enable this feature.
	Notes: multiple instances of b10-auth still make separate copies
	of the memory image.  Also, loading zones in memory still suspends
	query processing, so manual reloading or reloading after incoming
	transfer may cause service disruption for huge zones.

	The logger now uses a lockfile named `logger_lockfile' that is
	created in the local state directory to mutually separate
	individual logging operations from various processes. This is

	together in the middle of lines. The `logger_lockfile` is created
	with file permission mode 0660. BIND 10's local state directory
	should be writable and perhaps have g+s mode bit so that the
	`logger_lockfile` can be opened by a group of processes.

	backend database schema. Currently it only supports sqlite3 databases.
	Note: there's no schema change that requires this utility as of

412.	[func]		jelte
	Added a command-line option '--clear-config' to bind10, which causes
	the system to create a backup of the existing configuration database

	Configuration commands in bindctl now check for list indices if
	the 'identifier' argument points to a child element of a list
	item. Previously, it was possible to 'get' non-existent values
	by leaving out the index, e.g. "config show Auth/listen_on/port,
	which should be config show Auth/listen_on[<index>]/port, since
	Auth/listen_on is a list. The command without an index will now
	show an error. It is still possible to show/set the entire list

	The new query handling module of b10-auth did not handle type DS
	query correctly: It didn't look for it in the parent zone, and

	Due to the socket creator changes, b10-auth and b10-resolver
	are no longer needed to start as root. They are started as
	the user they should be running, so they no longer have
	the -u flag for switching the user after initialization.
	Note: this change broke backward compatibility to boss component
	configuration.  If your b10-config.db contains "setuid" for
	Boss.components, you'll need to remove that entry by hand before
	starting BIND 10.

	Corrected SOA serial check in xfrout.  It now compares the SOA

	b10-resolver ignored default configuration parameters if listen_on
	failed (this can easily happen especially for a test environment
	where the run time user doesn't have root privilege), and even if
	listen_on was updated later the resolver wouldn't work correctly
	unless it's fully restarted (for example, all queries would be

	The DataSourceClientContainer class that dynamically loads
	datasource backend libraries no longer provides just a .so file name

	different version is installed).
	These loadable libraries are also no longer installed in the default
	library path, but in a subdirectory of the libexec directory of the
	target ($prefix/libexec/[version]/backends).
	This also removes the need to handle b10-xfin and b10-xfrout as

	and responds with proper ADVERTISE and REPLY. Note that since
	LeaseManager is not implemented, server assigns the same
	hardcoded lease for every client. This change removes existing

	b10-xfrout: ACLs for xfrout can now be configured per zone basis.
	A per zone ACL is part of a more general zone configuration.  A
	quick example for configuring an ACL for zone "example.com" that
	rejects any transfer request for that zone is as follows:
	> config add Xfrout/zone_config
	> config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/origin "example.com"
	> config add Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl
	> config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl[0] {"action": "REJECT"}
	The previous global ACL (query_acl) was renamed to transfer_acl,
	which now works as the default ACL.  Note: backward compatibility
	is not provided, so an existing configuration using query_acl
	needs to be updated by hand.

	Resolved that the stats module wasn't configurable in bindctl in
	spite of its having configuration items. The configuration part
	was removed from the original spec file "stats.spec" and was
	placed in a new spec file "stats-schema.spec". Because it means
	definitions of statistics items. The command part is still
	there. Thus stats module currently has no its own configuration,
	and the items in "stats-schema.spec" are neither visible nor
	configurable through bindctl. "stats-schema.spec" is shared with
	stats module and stats-httpd module, and maybe with other
	statistical modules in future. "stats.spec" has own configuration
	and commands of stats module, if it requires.

	Added the HTTP/XML interface (b10-stats-httpd) to the
	statistics feature in BIND 10. b10-stats-httpd is a standalone
	HTTP server and it requests statistics data to the stats
	daemon (b10-stats) and sends it to HTTP clients in XML
	format. Items of the data collected via b10-stats-httpd
	are almost equivalent to ones which are collected via
	bindctl. Since it also can send XSL (Extensible Stylesheet
	Language) document and XSD (XML Schema definition) document,
	XML document is human-friendly to view through web browsers
	and its data types are strictly defined.

	Also, mainly for the purpose of tests, a new option "--pid-file"
	was added to BoB, with which the boss process will dump its PID

	Code specifies the message to be logged via a symbol, and the

	b10-xfrin/b10-zonemgr: Fixed a bug where these programs didn't
	receive command responses from CC sessions.  Eventually the

	b10-auth: Added new configuration variable "statistics-interval"
	to allow the user to change the timer interval for periodic
	statistics updates.  The update can also be disabled by setting

	(Trac #478, git ea4a481003d80caf2bff8d0187790efd526d72ca)

146.	[func]		jelte
	Command arguments were not validated internally against their

145.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a new command 'loadzone' for (re)loading a
	specific zone.  The command syntax is generic but it is currently
	only feasible for class IN in memory data source.  To reload a
	zone "example.com" via bindctl, execute the command as follows:
	> Auth loadzone origin = example.com
	(Trac #467 git 4f7e1f46da1046de527ab129a88f6aad3dba7562
	from 1d7d3918661ba1c6a8b1e40d8fcbc5640a84df12)

144.	[build]		jinmei
	Introduced a workaround for clang++ build on FreeBSD (and probably
	some other OSes).  If building BIND 10 fails with clang++ due to
	a link error about "__dso_handle", try again from the configure
	script with CXX_LIBTOOL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib (the path actually
	doesn't matter; the important part is the -L flag).  This
	workaround is not automatically enabled as it's difficult to
	detect the need for it dynamically, and must be enabled via the
	variable by hand.
	(Trac #474, git cfde436fbd7ddf3f49cbbd153999656e8ca2a298)

143.	[build]		jinmei
	Fixed build problems with clang++ in unit tests due to recent
	changes.  No behavior change. (Trac #448, svn r4133)

142.	[func]		jinmei
	b10-auth: updated query benchmark so that it can test in memory
	data source.  Also fixed a bug that the output buffer isn't
	cleared after query processing, resulting in misleading results
	or program crash.  This is a regression due to change #135.
	(Trac #465, svn r4103)

141.	[bug]		jinmei
	b10-auth: Fixed a bug that the authoritative server includes
	trailing garbage data in responses.  This is a regression due to
	change #135. (Trac #462, svn r4081)

140.	[func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:
	  ... "auth.queries.tcp": 1, "auth.queries.udp": 1 ...
	Using the "Auth sendstats" command you can make b10-auth send the
	counters to b10-stats immediately.
	(Trac #347, svn r4026)

139.	[build]		jreed
	Introduced configure option and make targets for generating
	Python code coverage report. This adds new make targets:
	report-python-coverage and clean-python-coverage. The C++
	code coverage targets were renamed to clean-cpp-coverage
	and report-cpp-coverage. (Trac #362, svn r4023)

138.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a configuration interface to support in memory
	data sources.  For example, the following command to bindctl
	will configure a memory data source containing the "example.com"
	zone with the zone file named "example.com.zone":
	> config set Auth/datasources/ [{"type": "memory", "zones": \
	 [{"origin": "example.com", "file": "example.com.zone"}]}]
	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be
	configured explicitly.  To disable it again, specify a null list
	for Auth/datasources:
	> config set Auth/datasources/ []
	Notes: it's currently for class IN only.  The zone files are not
	actually loaded into memory yet (which will soon be implemented).
	This is an experimental feature and the syntax may change in
	future versions.
	(Trac #446, svn r3998)

	It has "listen_on" and "forward_addresses" options.
	(Trac #389, r3448)

131.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced two template classes RBTree and RBNode
	to provide the generic map with domain name as key and anything as
	the value. Because of some unresolved design issue, the new classes
	are only intended to be used by memory zone and zone table.
	(Trac #397, svn r3890)

130.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced a new class MemoryDataSrc to provide
	the general interface for memory data source.  For the initial
	implementation, we don't make it a derived class of AbstractDataSrc
	because the interface is so different (we'll eventually
	consider this as part of the generalization work).
	(Trac #422, svn r3866)

129.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added new functions masterLoad() for loading master
	zone files.  The initial implementation can only parse a limited
	form of master files, but BIND 9's named-compilezone can convert
	any valid zone file into the acceptable form.
	(Trac #423, svn r3857)

128.	[build]		vorner
	Test for query name = '.', type = DS to authoritative nameserver

	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

121.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is
	not much of real use, however, because no protocol support was
	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

120.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

117.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the
	support of in memory data source.  This is an intermediate step to
	the bigger feature, and is not yet actually usable in practice.
	(Trac #399, svn r3590)

116.	[bug]		jerry
	src/bin/xfrout: Xfrout and Auth will communicate by long tcp
	connection, Auth needs to make a new connection only on the first
	time or if an error occurred.
	(Trac #299, svn r3482)

115.	[func]*		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Changed DNS message flags and section names from
	separate classes to simpler enums, considering the balance between
	type safety and usability.  API has been changed accordingly.
	More documentation and tests were provided with these changes.
	(Trac #358, r3439)

114.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported clang++.  Note: Boost >= 1.44 is required.
	(Trac #365, svn r3383)

113.	[func]*		zhanglikun
	Folder name 'utils'(the folder in /src/lib/python/isc/) has been
	renamed	to 'util'. Programs that used 'import isc.utils.process'
	now need to use 'import isc.util.process'. The folder
	/src/lib/python/isc/Util is removed since it isn't used by any
	program. (Trac #364, r3382)

112.	[func]		zhang likun
	Add one mixin class to override the naive serve_forever() provided
	in python library socketserver. Instead of polling for shutdown
	every poll_interval seconds, one socketpair is used to wake up
	the waiting server. (Trac #352, svn r3366)

111.	[bug]*		Vaner
	Make sure process xfrin/xfrout/zonemgr/cmdctl can be stopped
	properly when user enter "ctrl+c" or 'Boss shutdown' command
	through bindctl.  The ZonemgrRefresh.run_timer and
	NotifyOut.dispatcher spawn a thread themselves.
	(Trac #335, svn r3273)

110.	[func]		Vaner
	Added isc.net.check module to check ip addresses and ports for
	correctness and isc.net.addr to hold IP address. The bind10, xfrin
	and cmdctl programs are modified to use it.
	(Trac #353, svn r3240)

109.	[func]		naokikambe
	Added the initial version of the stats module for the statistics
	feature of BIND 10, which supports the restricted features and
	items and reports via bindctl command. (Trac #191, r3218)
	Added the document of the stats module, which is about how stats
	module collects the data (Trac #170, [wiki:StatsModule])

108.	[func]		jerry
	src/bin/zonemgr: Provide customizable configurations for
	lowerbound_refresh, lowerbound_retry, max_transfer_timeout and
	jitter_scope. (Trac #340, r3205)

107.	[func]		likun
	Remove the parameter 'db_file' for command 'retransfer' of
	xfrin module. xfrin.spec will not be generated by script.
	(Trac #329, r3171)

106.	[bug]		likun
	When xfrin can't connect with one zone's master, it should tell
	the bad news to zonemgr, so that zonemgr can reset the timer for
	that zone. (Trac #329, r3170)

105.	[bug]		Vaner
	Python processes: they no longer take 100% CPU while idle
	due to a busy loop in reading command session in a nonblocking way.
	(Trac #349, svn r3153), (Trac #382, svn r3294)

104.	[bug]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: zonemgr should be attempting to refresh expired zones.
	(Trac #336, r3139)

103.	[bug]		jerry
	lib/python/isc/log: Fixed an issue with python logging,
	python log shouldn't die with OSError. (Trac #267, r3137)

102.	[build]		jinmei
	Disable threads in ASIO to minimize build time dependency.
	(Trac #345, r3100)

101.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Completed Opcode and Rcode implementation with more
	tests and documentation.  API is mostly the same but the
	validation was a bit tightened. (Trac #351, svn r3056)

100.	[func]		Vaner
	Python processes: support naming of python processes so
	they're not all called python3.
	(Trac #322, svn r3052)

99.	[func]*		jinmei
	Introduced a separate EDNS class to encapsulate EDNS related
	information more cleanly.  The related APIs are changed a bit,
	although it won't affect most of higher level applications.
	(Trac #311, svn r3020)

98.	[build]		jinmei
	The ./configure script now tries to search some common include
	paths for boost header files to minimize the need for explicit
	configuration with --with-boost-include. (Trac #323, svn r3006)

97.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a micro benchmark test for query processing of b10-auth.
	(Trac #308, svn r2982)

96.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed two small issues with configure: Do not set CXXFLAGS so that
	it can be customized; Make sure --disable-static works.
	(Trac #325, r2976)

bind10-devel-20100917 released on September 17, 2010

95.	[doc, bug]	jreed
	Add b10-zonemgr manual page. Update other docs to introduce
	this secondary manager.
	bin/xfrout and bin/zonemgr: Fixed some stderr output.
	(Trac #341, svn r2951)
	(Trac #342, svn r2949)

94.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/xfrout:  Fixed a problem in xfrout where only 2 or 3 RRs
	were used per DNS message in the xfrout stream.
	(Trac #334, r2931)

93.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: A DS query could crash the library (and therefore,
	e.g. the authoritative server) if some RR of the same apex name
	is stored in the hot spot cache. (Trac #307, svn r2923)

92.	[func]*		jelte
	libdns_python (the python wrappers for libdns++) has been renamed
	to pydnspp (Python DNS++). Programs and libraries that used
	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

88.	[func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

87.	[func]		zhanglikun
	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one
	of the co-operating processes of BIND 10, which keeps track of
	timers and other information necessary for BIND 10 to act as a
	slave. (Trac #215, svn r2737)

85.	[build]*		jinmei
	Build programs using dynamic link by default.  A new configure
	option --enable-static-link is provided to force static link for
	executable programs.  Statically linked programs can be run on a
	debugger more easily and would be convenient for developers.
	(Trac #309, svn r2723)

bind10-devel-20100812 released on August 12, 2010

84.	[bug]		jinmei, jerry
	This is a quick fix patch for the issue: AXFR fails half the
	time because of connection problems. xfrout client will make
	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

83.	[build]*		jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

82.	[func]		jinmei
	bin/auth: Added -u option to change the effective process user
	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

81.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a C++ framework for micro benchmark tests.  A supplemental
	library functions to build query data for the tests were also
	provided. (Trac #241, svn r2664)

80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or
	non-running modules (for the latter, this is until we have a
	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's
	already running (listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

73.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

71.	[func]		each
	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

70.	[func]		each
	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

69.	[func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

68.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c (--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file',
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

67.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

66.	[bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)

65.	[func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

64.	[func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

63.	[func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

62.	[func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

61.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc, bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Trac #136, svn r2147)

54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(),
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process,
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't
	be removed, exit from python.
	(Trac #151, svn r2091)

bind10-devel-20100602 released on June 2, 2010

51.	[build]		jelte
	lib/python: Add bind10_config.py module for paths and
	possibly other configure-time variables. Allow some components
	to find spec files in build tree when ran from source.
	(Trac #223)

50.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

48.	[func]		jelte
	bin/auth: Use asio's io_service for the msgq handling.
	(svn r2007)

47.	[func]		zhanglikun

	configure output. (svn r1836)

39.	[func]*		each
	Renamed libauth to libdatasrc.

38.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.
	Remove unused socket file when Xfrout process exits. Make sure Xfrout
	exit by itself when it receives SIGINT, instead of being killed by the
	signal SIGTERM or SIGKILL sent from boss.
	(Trac #135, #151, #134, svn r1797)

37.	[build]		jinmei
	Check for the availability of python-config. (Trac #159,
	svn r1794)

36.	[func]		shane
	bin/bind10:	Miscellaneous code cleanups and improvements.
	(Trac #40, svn r2012)

	bin/bindctl: fixed a bug that it didn't accept IPv6 addresses as
	command arguments. (Trac #219, svn r2022)

34.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/xfrin: fixed several small bugs with many additional unit
	tests.  Fixes include: IPv6 transport support, resource leak,
	and non IN class support. (Trac #185, svn r2000)

33.	[bug]		each
	bin/auth: output now prepended with "[b10-auth]" (Trac
	#109, svn r1985)

32.	[func]*		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
        boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
        headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
        using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)

31.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)

30.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

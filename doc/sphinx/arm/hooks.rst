Introduction
============

Kea is both flexible and customizable, via the use of "hooks." This feature
lets Kea load one or more
dynamically linked libraries (known as "hook libraries") and call functions
in them at various points in its processing ("hook points").
Those functions perform whatever custom processing is required.

The hooks concept allows the core Kea code to remain reasonably small
by moving features that only some, but not all, users find useful to
external libraries. Those with no need for certain functions can simply choose not
to load those libraries.

Hook libraries are loaded by individual Kea processes, not by Kea as a
whole. This means, among other things, that it is possible to associate one set
of libraries with the DHCPv4 server and a different set with the DHCPv6
server.

It is also possible for a process to load
multiple libraries. When processing reaches a hook point, Kea calls the
hook library functions attached to it. If multiple libraries have
attached a function to a given hook point, Kea calls all of them, in the
order in which the libraries are specified in the configuration file.
The order may be important; consult the documentation of the libraries
for specifics.

When a Kea process unloads a library, it expects the ``dlclose`` function
to remove all library symbols, as well as the library code, from address space.
Although most OSes implement the ``dlclose`` function, this behavior is not
required by the POSIX standard and not all systems support it; for example, the musl
library, used by default by Alpine Linux, implements the ``dlclose`` function
as a no operation. On such systems a library actually remains loaded for the
lifetime of the process, which means that it must be restarted
to update libraries with newer versions; it is not sufficient to simply
reconfigure or reload the Kea process.

The next sections describe how to install and configure hook libraries. Users who are
interested in writing their own hook library can find information
in the `Hooks Developer's Guide section of the Kea Developer's
Guide <https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/df/d46/hooksdgDevelopersGuide.html>`__.

Note that some libraries are available under different licenses.

Please also note that some libraries may require additional dependencies and/or
compilation switches to be enabled, e.g. the RADIUS library
requires the FreeRadius-client library to be present. If
the ``--with-freeradius`` option is not specified, the RADIUS library is not
built.

Installing Hook Packages
========================

.. note::

   For more details about installing the Kea Premium Hooks package, please read
   `this Knowledgebase article <https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-01587>`__.

Some hook packages are included in the base Kea sources. There is no
need to do anything special to compile or install them, as they are covered
by the usual building and installation procedures. Please
refer to :ref:`installation` for a general overview of the installation process.

ISC provides several additional premium hooks in the form of packages, which
follow a similar installation procedure but with several additional steps.
For our users' convenience, the premium hooks installation procedure is described in this section.

1. Download the package; detailed instructions are provided in the KB article
above. The package will be a file with a name similar to
``kea-premium-|release|.tar.gz``. (The name may vary depending on the package
purchased.)

2. Administrators who have the sources for the corresponding version of the
open-source Kea package on their system from the initial Kea installation
should skip this step. Otherwise, extract the Kea source from the original
tarball that was downloaded. For example, with a download of Kea |release|,
there should be a tarball called ``kea-|release|.tar.gz`` on the system.
Unpack this tarball:

.. parsed-literal::

   $ tar -zxvf kea-|release|.tar.gz

This will unpack the tarball into the ``kea-|release|`` subdirectory of
the current working directory.

3. Unpack the Kea premium hooks tarball into the same directory where the
original Kea source is located. Once Kea |release| has been unpacked into a ``kea-|release|``
subdirectory and the Kea premium tarball is in the current directory, the following
steps will unpack the premium tarball into the correct location:

.. parsed-literal::

     $ cd kea-|release|
     $ tar -xvf ../kea-premium-|release|.tar.gz

Note that unpacking the Kea premium package puts the files into a
directory named ``premium``. Regardless of the name of the package, the
directory is always called ``premium``, although its contents will vary
depending on the hooks package.

4. Run the ``autoreconf`` tools. This step is necessary to update Kea's build
script to include the additional directory. If this tool is not already
available on the system, install the ``automake`` and ``autoconf``
tools. To generate the configure script, please use:

::

     $ autoreconf -i

5. Rerun ``configure``, using the same configuration options that were used when
originally building Kea. It is possible to verify that ``configure`` has detected the
premium package by inspecting the summary printed when it exits. The
first section of the output should look something like this:

.. parsed-literal::

   Package:
     Name:             kea
     Version:          |release|
     Extended version: |release| (tarball)
     OS Family:        Linux
     Using GNU sed:    yes
     Premium package:  yes
     Included Hooks:   forensic_log flex_id host_cmds

The last line indicates which specific hooks were detected. Note that
some hooks may require their own dedicated switches, e.g. the RADIUS hook
requires extra switches for FreeRADIUS. Please consult later sections of
this chapter for details.

6. Rebuild Kea.

::

     $ make

If the machine has multiple CPU cores, an interesting option to consider
here is using the argument ``-j X``, where ``X`` is the number of available cores.

7. Install Kea sources along with the hooks:

::

   $ sudo make install

Note that as part of the installation procedure, the install script
places additional hook libraries and associated files into the ``premium/`` directory.

The installation location of the hook libraries depends on whether the
``--prefix`` parameter was specified in the ``configure`` script. If not,
the default location is ``/usr/local/lib/kea/hooks``. The proper installation
of the libraries can be verified with this command:

::

   $ ls -l /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/*.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_class_cmds.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_flex_id.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_flex_option.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_host_cmds.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_lease_cmds.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_legal_log.so
   /usr/local/lib/kea/hooks/libdhcp_subnet_cmds.so

The exact list returned depends on the packages installed. If the
directory was specified via ``--prefix``, the hook libraries will be located in
``{prefix directory}/lib/kea/hooks``.

Configuring Hook Libraries
===========================

The hook libraries for a given process are configured using the
``hooks-libraries`` keyword in the configuration for that process. (Note
that the word "hooks" is plural.) The value of the keyword is an array
of map structures, with each structure corresponding to a hook library. For
example, to set up two hook libraries for the DHCPv4 server, the
configuration would be:

::

   "Dhcp4": {
       :
       "hooks-libraries": [
           {
               "library": "/opt/charging.so"
           },
           {
               "library": "/opt/local/notification.so",
               "parameters": {
                   "mail": "spam@example.com",
                   "floor": 13,
                   "debug": false,
                   "users": [ "alice", "bob", "charlie" ],
                   "languages": {
                       "french": "bonjour",
                       "klingon": "yl'el"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
       :
   }

.. note::

   Libraries are reloaded even if their lists have not changed,
   because the parameters specified for the library (or the files those
   parameters point to) may have changed.

As of Kea 2.4.2, hook libraries may only be loaded from the default installation
directory determined during compilation and shown in the config report as
"Hooks directory".  This value may be overridden at startup by setting the
environment variable ``KEA_HOOKS_PATH`` to the desired path.  If a path other
than this value is used in a ``library`` element Kea will emit an error and refuse
to load the library. For ease of use ``library`` elements may simply omit path
components, specifying the file name only as shown below:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Dhcp6": {
            "hooks-libraries": [
                {
                    "library": "first_custom_hooks_example.so"
                },
                {
                    "library": "second_custom_hooks_example.so"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

This snippet (on Debian 12) is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Dhcp6": {
            "hooks-libraries": [
                {
                    "library": "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/kea/hooks/first_custom_hooks_example.so"
                },
                {
                    "library": "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/kea/hooks/second_custom_hooks_example.so"
                }
            ]
        }
    }

Libraries may have additional parameters that are not mandatory, in the
sense that there may be libraries that do not require them. However, for any
given library there is often a requirement to specify a certain
set of parameters. Please consult the documentation for each individual library for
details. In the example above, the first library (``/opt/charging.so``) has no parameters. The
second library (``/opt/local/notification.so``) has five parameters: specifying mail (string parameter),
floor (integer parameter), debug (boolean parameter), lists
(list of strings), and maps (containing strings). Nested parameters can
be used if the library supports it. This topic is explained in detail in
the `Hooks Developer's Guide section of the Kea Developer's Guide
<https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/df/d46/hooksdgDevelopersGuide.html>`__.

Some hooks use user context to set the parameters. See :ref:`user-context-hooks`.

Notes:

-  The full path to each library should be given.

-  As noted above, the order in which the hooks are called may be important;
   consult the documentation for each library for specifics.

-  An empty list has the same effect as omitting the ``hooks-libraries``
   configuration element altogether.

   .. note::

      There is one case where this is not true: if Kea is running with a
      configuration that contains a ``hooks-libraries`` item, and that
      item is removed and the configuration reloaded, the removal will
      be ignored and the libraries remain loaded. As a workaround,
      instead of removing the ``hooks-libraries`` item, change it to an
      empty list.

At the moment, only the :iscman:`kea-dhcp4` and :iscman:`kea-dhcp6` processes support
hook libraries.

.. _order-of-configuration-hooks:

Order of Configuration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is important to recognize that the order in which hook libraries are
configured determines the order in which their callouts will be executed,
in cases where more than one hook library implements the same callout.  For
example, if you wish to use the flex-id hook library to formulate the client
IDs in conjunction with HA hook library for load-balanced HA, it is essential
that the flex-id library be specified first in your server's ``hooks-libraries``
section.  This ensures that the client ID is formulated by the flex-id library
before the HA library uses it for load-balancing. Similarly it would be best to
specify forensic logging last, to ensure any other install hooks have made
their contributions to the packet processing.

.. _user-context-hooks:

User Contexts in Hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hook libraries can have their own configuration parameters, which is
convenient if the parameter applies to the whole library. However,
sometimes it is useful to extend certain configuration entities
with additional configuration data. This is where the concept
of user contexts comes in. A system administrator can define an arbitrary set of
data and attach it to Kea structures, as long as the data is specified
as a JSON map. In particular, it is possible to define fields that are
integers, strings, boolean, lists, or maps. It is possible to define
nested structures of arbitrary complexity. Kea does not use that data on
its own; it simply stores it and makes it available for the hook libraries.

Another use case for user contexts may be storing comments and other
information that will be retained by Kea. Regular comments are discarded
when the configuration is loaded, but user contexts are retained. This is
useful if administrators want their comments to survive :isccmd:`config-set` or :isccmd:`config-get`
operations, for example.

If user context is supported in a given context, the parser translates
"comment" entries into user context with a "comment" entry.

User context can store configuration for multiple hooks and comments at once.

Some hooks use user context for a configuration that can be easily edited
without the need to restart the server.

The DDNS-Tuning Hook uses user-context to configure per subnet behavior. Example:

::

    "subnet4": [{
        "id": 1,
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        "pools": [{
            "pool": "192.0.2.10 - 192.0.2.20"
        } ],
        "user-context": {
            "ddns-tuning": {
                "hostname-expr": "'guest-'+int8totext(substring(pkt4.yiaddr, 0,1))+'-' \
                                          +int8totext(substring(pkt4.yiaddr, 1,2))+'-' \
                                          +int8totext(substring(pkt4.yiaddr, 2,3))+'-' \
                                          +int8totext(substring(pkt4.yiaddr, 3,4))"
            },
            "last-modified": "2017-09-04 13:32",
            "phones": [ "x1234", "x2345" ],
            "devices-registered": 42,
            "billing": false
        }
    }]


The Limits hook uses user-context in classes and subnets to set parameters. For example:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "Dhcp6": {
        "client-classes": [
          {
            "name": "gold",
            "user-context": {
              "limits": {
                "address-limit": 2,
                "prefix-limit": 1,
                "rate-limit": "1000 packets per second"
              }
            }
          }
        ],
        "hooks-libraries": [
          {
            "library": "/usr/local/lib/libdhcp_limits.so"
          }
        ],
        "subnet6": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "pools": [
              {
                "pool": "2001:db8::/64"
              }
            ],
            "subnet": "2001:db8::/64",
            "user-context": {
              "limits": {
                "address-limit": 4,
                "prefix-limit": 2,
                "rate-limit": "10 packets per minute"
              }
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Available Hook Libraries
========================

As described above, the hook functionality provides a way to customize
a Kea server without modifying the core code. ISC has chosen to take
advantage of this feature to provide functions that may only be useful
to a subset of Kea users. To this end, ISC has created some hook
libraries, discussed in the following sections.

.. note::

   Some of these libraries are available with the base code, while others are
   premium libraries available for purchase, or only shared with organizations
   who contribute to Kea's development through paid ISC support contracts. Paid support
   includes professional engineering assistance, advance security notifications, input
   into ISC's roadmap planning, and many other benefits, while helping
   keep Kea sustainable in the long term. ISC encourages companies and organizations
   to consider purchasing a paid support contract; further information can be
   obtained by completing the form at https://www.isc.org/contact.

The following table provides a list of hook libraries currently available
from ISC. It is important to pay attention to which libraries may be
loaded by which Kea processes. It is a common mistake to configure the
:iscman:`kea-ctrl-agent` process to load libraries that should, in fact, be
loaded by the :iscman:`kea-dhcp4` or :iscman:`kea-dhcp6` processes. If a library
from ISC does not work as expected, please make sure that it has been
loaded by the correct process per the table below.

ISC hopes to see more hook libraries become available as time
progresses, developed both internally and externally. Since this list
may evolve dynamically, it is maintained on a wiki page, available
at https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/wikis/Hooks-available.
Developers or others who are aware of any hook libraries not listed there
are asked to please send a note to the kea-users or kea-dev mailing lists for
updating. (Information on all of ISC's public mailing lists can be found
at https://www.isc.org/mailinglists/.)

The libraries developed by ISC are described in detail in the following

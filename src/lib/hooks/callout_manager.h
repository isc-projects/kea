/// @brief Callout Manager
///
/// This class manages the registration, deregistration and execution of the
/// library callouts.  It is part of the hooks framework used by the BIND 10
/// server, and is not for use by user-written code in a hooks library.
///
/// In operation, the class needs to know two items of data:
///
/// - The list of server hooks, which is used in two ways.  Firstly, when a
///   callout registers or deregisters a hook, it does so by name: the
///   @ref isc::util::ServerHooks object supplies the names of registered
///   hooks.  Secondly, when the callouts associated with a hook are called by
///   the server, the server supplies the index of the relevant hook: this is
///   validated by reference to the list of hook.
///
/// - The number of loaded libraries.  Each callout registered by a user
///   library is associated with that library, the callout manager storing both
///   a pointer to the callout and the index of the library in the list of
///   loaded libraries.  Callouts are allowed to dynamically register and
///   deregister callouts in the same library (including themselves): they
///   cannot affect callouts registered by another library.  When calling a
///   callout, the callout manager maintains the idea of a "current library
///   index": if the callout calls one of the callout registration functions
///   (indirectly via the @ref LibraryHandle object), the registration
///   functions use the "current library index" in their processing.
///
/// These two items of data are supplied when an object of this class is
/// constructed.  The latter (number of libraries) can be updated after the
/// class is constructed.  (Such an update is used during library loading where
/// the CalloutManager has to be constructed before the libraries are loaded,
/// but one of the libraries subsequently fails to load.)
///
/// The library index is important because it determines in what order callouts
/// on a particular hook are called.  For each hook, the CalloutManager
/// maintains a vector of callouts ordered by library index.  When a callout
/// is added to the list, it is added at the end of the callouts associated
/// with the current library.  To clarify this further, suppose that three
/// libraries are loaded, A (assigned an index 1), B (assigned an index 2) and
/// C (assigned an index 3).  Suppose A registers two callouts on a given hook,
/// A1 and A2 (in that order) B registers B1 and B2 (in that order) and C
/// registers C1 and C2 (in that order).  Internally, the callouts are stored
/// in the order A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2: this is also the order in which
/// the are called.  If B now registers another callout (B3), it is added to
/// the vector after the list of callouts associated with B: the new order is
/// therefore A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C1 and C2.
///
/// Indexes range between 1 and n (where n is the number of the libraries
/// loaded) and are assigned to libraries based on the order the libraries
/// presented to the hooks framework for loading (something that occurs in the
/// isc::util::HooksManager) class.  However, two other indexes are recognised,
/// 0 and INT_MAX.  These are used when the server itself registers callouts -
/// the server is able to register callouts that get called before any
/// user-library callouts, and ones that get called after user-library callouts.
/// In other words, assuming the callouts on a hook are A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C2,
/// C2 as before, and that the server registers S1 (to run before the
/// user-registered callouts) and S2 (to run after them), the callouts are
/// stored (and executed) in the order S1, A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, C2, C2, S2.  In
/// summary, the recognised index values are:
///
/// - < 0: invalid.
/// - 0: used for server-registered callouts that are called before
///   user-registered callouts.
/// - 1 - n: callouts from user libraries.
/// - INT_MAX: used for server-registered callouts called after
///   user-registered callouts.
///
/// Note that the callout functions do not access the CalloutManager: instead,
/// they use a LibraryHandle object.  This contains an internal pointer to
/// the CalloutManager, but provides a restricted interface.  In that way,
/// callouts are unable to affect callouts supplied by other libraries.

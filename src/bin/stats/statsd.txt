= statsd Overview =

statsd gathers statistics from each BIND 10 components and dump them into a file periodically.

Currently, file path, dump frequency, rotate generations are fixed.
statsd dumps to "/tmp/stats" every 10 seconds except no statistics received.
"/tmp/stats" are preserved 100 generations.

= statistics channel Message format =

The statsd accepts python dictionary format data from msgq "statistics" channel.

The data need to contain "components", "version", "timestamp", "stats" keys.

The statistics data is { "component" : "<component_name>", "version": "<version number>", "timestamp": "<unixtime>", "stats": <python dictionary format statistics>}. "stats" data may be nested.

"stats" data is defined by each component.

Each component may send statistics data to "statistics" group periodically without joining the group.

See a example component: "stats/test/test-agent.py".

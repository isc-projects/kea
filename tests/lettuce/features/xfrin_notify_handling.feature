Feature: Xfrin incoming notify handling
    Tests for Xfrin incoming notify handling.

    Scenario: Handle incoming notify
    Given I have bind10 running with configuration xfrin/retransfer_master.conf with cmdctl port 47804 as master
    And wait for master stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
    And wait for master stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message XFROUT_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message ZONEMGR_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message STATS_STARTING

% DCTL_CCSESSION_ENDING %1 ending control channel session
This debug message is issued just before the controller attempts
to disconnect from its session with the BIND10 control channel.

% DCTL_CCSESSION_STARTING %1 starting control channel session, specfile: %2
This debug message is issued just before the controller attempts
to establish a session with the BIND10 control channel.

% DCTL_COMMAND_RECEIVED %1 received command %2, arguments: %3
A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND10 control system by the controller.

% DCTL_CONFIG_COMPLETE server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. It is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DCTL_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL %1 configuration failed to load: %2
This critical error message indicates that the initial application
configuration has failed. The service will start, but will not
process requests until the configuration has been corrected.

% DCTL_CONFIG_START parsing new configuration: %1
A debug message indicating that the application process has received an
updated configuration and has passed it to its configuration manager
for parsing.

% DCTL_CONFIG_STUB %1 configuration stub handler called
This debug message is issued when the dummy handler for configuration
events is called.  This only happens during initial startup.

% DCTL_CONFIG_UPDATE %1 updated configuration received: %2
A debug message indicating that the controller has received an
updated configuration from the BIND10 configuration system.

% DCTL_DISCONNECT_FAIL %1 controller failed to end session with BIND10: %2
This message indicates that while shutting down, the Dhcp-Ddns controller
encountered an error terminating communication with the BIND10. The service
will still exit.  While theoretically possible, this situation is rather
unlikely.

% DCTL_INIT_PROCESS %1 initializing the application
This debug message is issued just before the controller attempts
to create and initialize its application instance.

% DCTL_INIT_PROCESS_FAIL %1 application initialization failed: %2
This error message is issued if the controller could not initialize the
application and will exit.

% DCTL_NOT_RUNNING %1 application instance is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
application when it is not running.

% DCTL_ORDER_ERROR configuration contains more elements than the parsing order
An error message which indicates that configuration being parsed includes
element ids not specified the configuration manager's parse order list. This
is a programmatic error.

% DCTL_ORDER_NO_ELEMENT element: %1 is in the parsing order but is missing from the configuration
An error message output during a configuration update.  The program is
expecting an item but has not found it in the new configuration.  This may
mean that the BIND 10 configuration database is corrupt.

% DCTL_PARSER_FAIL configuration parsing failed for configuration element: %1, reason: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of the named
configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the parsing actions
and committal of changes failed.  The reason for the failure is given in
the message.

% DCTL_PROCESS_FAILED %1 application execution failed: %2
The controller has encountered a fatal error while running the
application and is terminating. The reason for the failure is
included in the message.

% DCTL_RUN_PROCESS %1 starting application event loop
This debug message is issued just before the controller invokes
the application run method.

% DCTL_SESSION_FAIL %1 controller failed to establish BIND10 session: %1
The controller has failed to establish communication with the rest of BIND
10 and will exit.

% DCTL_STANDALONE %1 skipping message queue, running standalone
This is a debug message indicating that the controller is running in the
application in standalone mode. This means it will not connected to the BIND10
message queue. Standalone mode is only useful during program development,
and should not be used in a production environment.

% DCTL_STARTING %1 controller starting, pid: %2
This is an informational message issued when controller for the
service first starts.

% DCTL_STOPPING %1 controller is exiting
This is an informational message issued when the controller is exiting
following a shut down (normal or otherwise) of the service.

% DHCP_DDNS_COMMAND command directive received, command: %1 - args: %2
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application command method
has been invoked.

% DHCP_DDNS_CONFIGURE configuration update received: %1
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application configure method
has been invoked.

% DHCP_DDNS_FAILED application experienced a fatal error: %1
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application encounters an
unrecoverable error from within the event loop.

% DHCP_DDNS_INVALID_NCR application received an invalid DNS update request: %1
This is an error message that indicates that an invalid request to update
a DNS entry was recevied by the application.  Either the format or the content
of the request is incorret. The request will be ignored.

% DHCP_DDNS_INVALID_RESPONSE received response to DNS Update message is malformed: %1
This is a debug message issued when the DHCP-DDNS application encountered an
error while decoding a response to DNS Update message. Typically, this error
will be encountered when a response message is malformed.

% DHCP_DDNS_NCR_UDP_LISTEN_CLOSE application encountered an error while closing the UDP socket used to receive NameChangeRequests : %1
This is an error message that indicates the application was unable to close the
UDP socket being used to receive NameChangeRequests.  Socket closure may occur
during the course of error recovery or duing normal shutdown procedure.  In
either case the error is unlikely to impair the application's ability to
process requests but it should be reported for analysis.

% DHCP_DDNS_NCR_UDP_RECV_ERROR UDP socket receive error while listening for DNS Update requests: %1
This is an error message indicating that an IO error occured while listening
over a UDP socket for DNS update requests. in the request. This could indicate
a network connectivity or system resource issue.

% DHCP_DDNS_NCR_UDP_SEND_CLOSE application encountered an error while closing the UDP socket used to send NameChangeRequests : %1
This is an error message that indicates the DHCP-DDNS client was unable to close
the UDP socket being used to send NameChangeRequests.  Socket closure may occur
during the course of error recovery or duing normal shutdown procedure.  In
either case the error is unlikely to impair the client's ability to send
requests but it should be reported for analysis.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_MATCH No DNS servers match FQDN: %1
This is warning message issued when there are no domains in the configuration
which match the cited fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  The DNS Update
request for the FQDN cannot be processed.

% DHCP_DDNS_PROCESS_INIT application init invoked
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application enters
its init method.

% DHCP_DDNS_RUN_ENTER application has entered the event loop
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application enters
its run method.

% DHCP_DDNS_RUN_EXIT application is exiting the event loop
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns exits the
in event loop.

% DHCP_DDNS_SHUTDOWN application is performing a normal shut down
This is a debug message issued when the application has been instructed
to shut down by the controller.

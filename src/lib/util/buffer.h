///\brief The \c InputBuffer class is a buffer abstraction for manipulating
/// read-only data.
///
/// The main purpose of this class is to provide a safe placeholder for
/// examining wire-format data received from a network.
///
/// Applications normally use this class only in a limited situation: as an
/// interface between legacy I/O operation (such as receiving data from a BSD
/// socket) and the rest of the BIND10 DNS library.  One common usage of this
/// class for an application would therefore be something like this:
///
/// \code unsigned char buf[1024];
/// struct sockaddr addr;
/// socklen_t addrlen = sizeof(addr);
/// int cc = recvfrom(s, buf, sizeof(buf), 0, &addr, &addrlen);
/// InputBuffer buffer(buf, cc);
/// // pass the buffer to a DNS message object to parse the message \endcode
///
/// Other BIND10 DNS classes will then use methods of this class to get access
/// to the data, but the application normally doesn't have to care about the
/// details.
///
/// An \c InputBuffer object internally holds a reference to the given data,
/// rather than make a local copy of the data.  Also, it does not have an
/// ownership of the given data.  It is application's responsibility to ensure
/// the data remains valid throughout the lifetime of the \c InputBuffer
/// object.  Likewise, this object generally assumes the data isn't modified
/// throughout its lifetime; if the application modifies the data while this
/// object retains a reference to it, the result is undefined.  The application
/// will also be responsible for releasing the data when it's not needed if it
/// was dynamically acquired.
///
/// This is a deliberate design choice: although it's safer to make a local
/// copy of the given data on construction, it would cause unacceptable
/// performance overhead, especially considering that a DNS message can be
/// as large as a few KB.  Alternatively, we could allow the object to allocate
/// memory internally and expose it to the application to store network data
/// in it.  This is also a bad design, however, in that we would effectively
/// break the abstraction employed in the class, and do so by publishing
/// "read-only" stuff as a writable memory region.  Since there doesn't seem to
/// be a perfect solution, we have adopted what we thought a "least bad" one.
///
/// Methods for reading data from the buffer generally work like an input
/// stream: it begins with the head of the data, and once some length of data
/// is read from the buffer, the next read operation will take place from the
/// head of the unread data.  An object of this class internally holds (a
/// notion of) where the next read operation should start.  We call it the

/// The main purpose of this class is to provide a safe workplace for

/// avoid buffer overrun.
///
/// Like for the \c InputBuffer class, applications normally use this class only

/// would be something like this:
///
/// \code OutputBuffer buffer(4096); // give a sufficiently large initial size
/// // pass the buffer to a DNS message object to construct a wire-format
/// // DNS message.
/// struct sockaddr to;
/// sendto(s, buffer.getData(), buffer.getLength(), 0, &to, sizeof(to));
/// \endcode
///
/// where the \c getData() method gives a reference to the internal memory
/// region stored in the \c buffer object.  This is a suboptimal design in that
/// it exposes an encapsulated "handle" of an object to its user.
/// Unfortunately, there is no easy way to avoid this without involving
/// expensive data copy if we want to use this object with a legacy API such as
/// a BSD socket interface.  And, indeed, this is one major purpose for this
/// object.  Applications should use this method only under such a special
/// circumstance.  It should also be noted that the memory region returned by
/// \c getData() may be invalidated after a subsequent write operation.
///
/// An \c OutputBuffer class object automatically extends its memory region when
/// data is written beyond the end of the current buffer.  However, it will
/// involve performance overhead such as reallocating more memory and copying
/// data.  It is therefore recommended to construct the buffer object with a
/// sufficiently large initial size.
/// The \c getCapacity() method provides the current maximum size of data
/// (including the portion already written) that can be written into the buffer
/// without causing memory reallocation.
///
/// Methods for writing data into the buffer generally work like an output
/// stream: it begins with the head of the buffer, and once some length of data
/// is written into the buffer, the next write operation will take place from
/// the end of the buffer.  Other methods to emulate "random access" are also
/// provided (e.g., \c writeUint16At()).  The normal write operations are
/// normally exception-free as this class automatically extends the buffer
/// when necessary.  However, in extreme cases such as an attempt of writing
/// multi-GB data, a separate exception (e.g., \c std::bad_alloc) may be thrown
/// by the system.  This also applies to the constructor with a very large
/// initial size.
///
/// Note to developers: it may make more sense to introduce an abstract base
/// class for the \c OutputBuffer and define the simple implementation as a
/// a concrete derived class.  That way we can provide flexibility for future
/// extension such as more efficient buffer implementation or allowing users
/// to have their own customized version without modifying the source code.
/// We in fact considered that option, but at the moment chose the simpler
/// approach with a single concrete class because it may make the
/// implementation unnecessarily complicated while we were still not certain
/// if we really want that flexibility.  We may revisit the class design as
/// we see more applications of the class.  The same considerations apply to

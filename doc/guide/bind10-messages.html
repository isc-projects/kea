      This document lists each message that can be logged by the
      programs in the BIND 10 package.  Each entry in this manual
      is of the form:
      </p><pre class="screen">IDENTIFICATION message-text</pre><p>
      ... where "IDENTIFICATION" is the message identification included
      in each message logged and "message-text" is the accompanying
      message text.  The "message-text" may include placeholders of the
      form "%1", "%2" etc.; these parameters are replaced by relevant
      values when the message is logged.
    </p><p>
      Each entry is also accompanied by a description giving more
      information about the circumstances that result in the message
      being logged.
    </p><p>

message to a separate process (e.g., forwarding dynamic update
requests to b10-ddns) to handle it, but it failed.  The authoritative
server returns SERVFAIL to the client on behalf of the separate
process.  The error could be configuration mismatch between b10-auth
and the recipient component, or it may be because the requests are
coming too fast and the receipient process cannot keep up with the
rate, or some system level failure.  In either case this means the
BIND 10 system is not working as expected, so the administrator should
look into the cause and address the issue.  The log message includes

This is a debug message, generated by the authoritative server when an
attempt to create a response to a received DNS packet has failed. The
reason for the failure is given in the log message. A SERVFAIL response
is sent back. The most likely cause of this is an error in the data
source implementation; it is either creating bad responses or raising
exceptions itself.
</p></dd><dt><a name="AUTH_RESPONSE_FAILURE_UNKNOWN"></a><span class="term">AUTH_RESPONSE_FAILURE_UNKNOWN unknown exception while building response to query</span></dt><dd><p>
This debug message is similar to AUTH_RESPONSE_FAILURE, but further
details about the error are unknown, because it was signaled by something

software bug in the underlying data source implementation.  In either
case if this message is logged the administrator should carefully
examine the underlying data source to see what exactly happens and
whether the data is still valid.  The zone name, its class, and the

b10-ddns tried to get configuration of some remote modules for its
operation, but it failed.  The most likely cause of this is that the
remote module has not fully started up and b10-ddns couldn't get the
configuration in a timely fashion.  b10-ddns attempts to retry it a
few times, imposing a short delay, hoping it eventually succeeds if
it's just a timing issue.  The number of total failed attempts is also
logged.  If it reaches an internal threshold b10-ddns considers it a
fatal error and terminates.  Even in that case, if b10-ddns is
configured as a "dispensable" component (which is the default), the
parent bind10 process will restart it, and there will be another
chance of getting the remote configuration successfully.  These are
not the optimal behavior, but it's believed to be sufficient in
practice (there would normally be no failure in the first place).  If
it really causes an operational trouble other than having a few of
these log messages, please submit a bug report; there can be several
ways to make it more sophisticated.  Another, less likely reason for
having this error is because the remote modules are not actually
configured to run.  If that's the case fixing the configuration should
solve the problem - either by making sure the remote module will run

b10-ddns received an update request via b10-auth, but the received
data failed to pass minimum validation: it was either broken wire
format data for a valid DNS message (e.g. it's shorter than the
fixed-length header), or the opcode is not update, or TSIG is included
in the request but it fails to validate.  Since b10-auth should have
performed this level of checks, such an error shouldn't be detected at
this stage and should rather be considered an internal bug.  This
event is therefore logged at the error level, and the request is
simply dropped.  Additional information of the error is also logged.

b10-ddns received a new update request from a client over TCP, but
the number of TCP clients being handled by the server already reached
the configured quota, so the latest client was rejected by closing
the connection.  The administrator may want to check the status of
b10-ddns, and if this happens even if the server is not very busy,
the quota may have to be increased.  Or, if it's more likely to be
malicious or simply bogus clients that somehow keep the TCP connection
open for a long period, maybe they should be rejected with an
appropriate ACL configuration or some lower layer filtering.  The
number of existing TCP clients are shown in the log, which should be
identical to the current quota.

b10-ddns had tried to send an update response over TCP, and it hadn't
been completed at that time, and a followup attempt to complete the
send operation failed due to some network I/O error.  While a network
error can happen any time, this event is quite unexpected for two
reasons.  First, since the size of a response to an update request
should be generally small, it's unlikely that the initial attempt
didn't fail but wasn't completed.  Second, since the first attempt
succeeded and the TCP connection had been established in the first
place, it's more likely for the subsequent attempt to succeed.  In any
case, there may not be able to do anything to fix it at the server
side, but the administrator may want to check the general reachability
with the client address.

</p></dd><dt><a name="DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE_FAIL"></a><span class="term">DDNS_SECONDARY_ZONES_UPDATE_FAIL failed to update secondary zone list: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
An error message.  b10-ddns was notified of updates to a list of
secondary zones from b10-zonemgr and tried to update its own internal
copy of the list, but it failed.  This can happen if the configuration
contains an error, and b10-zonemgr should also reject that update.
Unfortunately, in the current implementation there is no way to ensure
that both zonemgr and ddns have consistent information when an update
contains an error; further, as of this writing zonemgr has a bug that
it could partially update the list of secondary zones if part of the
list has an error (see Trac ticket #2038).  b10-ddns still keeps
running with the previous configuration, but it's strongly advisable
to check log messages from zonemgr, and if it indicates there can be
inconsistent state, it's better to restart the entire BIND 10 system
(just restarting b10-ddns wouldn't be enough, because zonemgr can have
partially updated configuration due to bug #2038).  The log message
contains an error description, but it's intentionally kept simple as
it's primarily a matter of zonemgr.  To know the details of the error,
log messages of zonemgr should be consulted.

Debug message.  b10-ddns has made updates to a zone based on an update
request and has successfully notified an external module of the updates.
The notified module will use that information for updating its own
state or any necessary protocol action such as zone reloading or sending
notify messages to secondary servers.
</p></dd><dt><a name="DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL"></a><span class="term">DDNS_UPDATE_NOTIFY_FAIL failed to notify %1 of updates to %2: %3</span></dt><dd><p>
b10-ddns has made updates to a zone based on an update request and
tried to notify an external component of the updates, but the
notification fails.  One possible cause of this is that the external
component is not really running and it times out in waiting for the
response, although it will be less likely to happen in practice
because these components will normally be configured to run when the
server provides the authoritative DNS service; ddns is rather optional
among them.  If this happens, however, it will suspend b10-ddns for a
few seconds during which it cannot handle new requests (some may be
delayed, some may be dropped, depending on the volume of the incoming
requests).  This is obviously bad, and if this error happens due to
this reason, the administrator should make sure the component in
question should be configured to run.  For a longer term, b10-ddns
should be more robust about this case such as by making this
notification asynchronously and/or detecting the existence of the
external components to avoid hopeless notification in the first place.
Severity of this error for the receiving components depends on the
type of the component.  If it's b10-xfrout, this means DNS notify
messages won't be sent to secondary servers of the zone.  It's
suboptimal, but not necessarily critical as the secondary servers will
try to check the zone's status periodically.  If it's b10-auth and the
notification was needed to have it reload the corresponding zone, it's
more serious because b10-auth won't be able to serve the new version
of the zone unless some explicit recovery action is taken.  So the
administrator needs to examine this message and takes an appropriate
action.  In either case, this notification is generally expected to
succeed; so the fact it fails itself means there's something wrong in
the BIND 10 system, and it would be advisable to check other log
messages.

advisable to check the message, and, if necessary, take an appropriate
action (e.g., restarting the DB server if it dies).  If this message

This debug message lists the parameters being set for the resolver.  These are:
query timeout: the timeout (in ms) used for queries originated by the resolver
to upstream servers.  Client timeout: the interval to resolve a query by
a client: after this time, the resolver sends back a SERVFAIL to the client
whilst continuing to resolve the query. Lookup timeout: the time at which the
resolver gives up trying to resolve a query.  Retry count: the number of times
the resolver will retry a query to an upstream server if it gets a timeout.
</p><p>
The client and lookup timeouts require a bit more explanation. The
resolution of the client query might require a large number of queries to
upstream nameservers.  Even if none of these queries timeout, the total time
taken to perform all the queries may exceed the client timeout.  When this
happens, a SERVFAIL is returned to the client, but the resolver continues
with the resolution process; data received is added to the cache.  However,
there comes a time - the lookup timeout - when even the resolver gives up.
At this point it will wait for pending upstream queries to complete or
timeout and drop the query.

The serial fields of the first and last SOAs of AXFR (including AXFR-style

"same" (not only for the serial), but it is still not clear what the
receiver should do if this condition does not hold.  There was a discussion
about this at the IETF dnsext wg:
http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg07908.html
and the general feeling seems that it would be better to reject the
transfer if a mismatch is detected.  On the other hand, also as noted
in that email thread, neither BIND 9 nor NSD performs any comparison
on the SOAs.  For now, we only check the serials (ignoring other fields)
and only leave a warning log message when a mismatch is found.  If it
turns out to happen with a real world primary server implementation
and that server actually feeds broken data (e.g. mixed versions of
zone), we can consider a stricter action.

The first SOA record in an IXFR response indicates the zone's serial
at the primary server is not newer than the client's.  This is
basically unexpected event because normally the client first checks
the SOA serial by an SOA query, but can still happen if the transfer
is manually invoked or (although unlikely) there is a rapid change at
the primary server between the SOA and IXFR queries.  The client
implementation confirms the whole response is this single SOA, and
aborts the transfer just like a successful case.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred is not found in the data source.  This can happen if a
secondary DNS server first tries to perform AXFR from a primary server
without creating the zone image beforehand (e.g. by b10-loadzone).  As
of this writing the xfrin process provides backward compatible
behavior to previous versions: creating a new one in the data source
not to surprise existing users too much.  This is probably not a good
idea, however, in terms of who should be responsible for managing
zones at a higher level.  In future it is more likely that a separate
zone management framework is provided, and the situation where the
given zone isn't found in xfrout will be treated as an error.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred has multiple SOA RRs.  Such a zone is broken, but could be
accidentally configured especially in a data source using "non
captive" backend database.  The implementation ignores entire SOA RRs
and tries to continue processing as if the zone were empty.  This
means subsequent AXFR can succeed and possibly replace the zone with
valid content, but an IXFR attempt will fail.

On starting an xfrin session, it is identified that the zone to be
transferred does not have an SOA RR in the data source.  This is not
necessarily an error; if a secondary DNS server first tries to perform
transfer from a primary server, the zone can be empty, and therefore
doesn't have an SOA.  Subsequent AXFR will fill in the zone; if the
attempt is IXFR it will fail in query creation.

The response to an SOA query prior to xfr indicated that the zone's
SOA serial at the primary server is smaller than that of the xfrin
client.  This is not necessarily an error especially if that
particular primary server is another secondary server which hasn't got
the latest version of the zone.  But if the primary server is known to
be the real source of the zone, some unexpected inconsistency may have
happened, and you may want to take a closer look.  In this case xfrin
doesn't perform subsequent zone transfer.

were not found in the data source.  The xfrout daemon fell back to
AXFR-style IXFR.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_IXFR_NO_ZONE"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_IXFR_NO_ZONE IXFR client %1, %2: zone not found with journal</span></dt><dd><p>
The requested zone in IXFR was not found in the data source
even though the xfrout daemon sucessfully found the SOA RR of the zone
in the data source.  This can happen if the administrator removed the
zone from the data source within the small duration between these
operations, but it's more likely to be a bug or broken data source.
Unless you know why this message was logged, and especially if it
happens often, it's advisable to check whether the data source is
valid for this zone.  The xfrout daemon considers it a possible,
though unlikely, event, and returns a response with an RCODE of
NOTAUTH.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_IXFR_UPTODATE"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_IXFR_UPTODATE IXFR client %1, %2: client version is new enough (theirs=%3, ours=%4)</span></dt><dd><p>
An IXFR request was received, but the client's SOA version is the same as
or newer than that of the server.  The xfrout server responds to the
request with the answer section being just one SOA of that version.
Note: as of this wrting the 'newer version' cannot be identified due to
the lack of support for the serial number arithmetic.  This will soon
be implemented.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_MODULECC_SESSION_ERROR"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_MODULECC_SESSION_ERROR error encountered by configuration/command module: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
There was a problem in the lower level module handling configuration and
control commands.  This could happen for various reasons, but the most likely
cause is that the configuration database contains a syntax error and xfrout
failed to start at initialization.  A detailed error message from the module
will also be displayed.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_NEW_CONFIG"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_NEW_CONFIG Update xfrout configuration</span></dt><dd><p>

</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_NOTIFY_COMMAND"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_NOTIFY_COMMAND received command to send notifies for %1/%2</span></dt><dd><p>
The xfrout daemon received a command on the command channel that
NOTIFY packets should be sent for the given zone.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_PARSE_QUERY_ERROR"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_PARSE_QUERY_ERROR error parsing query: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
There was a parse error while reading an incoming query. The parse
error is shown in the log message. A remote client sent a packet we
do not understand or support. The xfrout request will be ignored.
In general, this should only occur for unexpected problems like
memory allocation failures, as the query should already have been
parsed by the b10-auth daemon, before it was passed here.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_PROCESS_REQUEST_ERROR"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_PROCESS_REQUEST_ERROR error processing transfer request: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
There was an error in receiving a transfer request from b10-auth.
This is generally an unexpected event, but is possible when, for
example, b10-auth terminates in the middle of forwarding the request.
When this happens it's unlikely to be recoverable with the same
communication session with b10-auth, so b10-xfrout drops it and
waits for a new session.  In any case, this error indicates that
there's something very wrong in the system, so it's advisable to check
the over all status of the BIND 10 system.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_QUERY_DROPPED"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_QUERY_DROPPED %1 client %2: request to transfer %3 dropped</span></dt><dd><p>
The xfrout process silently dropped a request to transfer zone to
given host.  This is required by the ACLs.  The %2 represents the IP
address and port of the peer requesting the transfer, and the %3
represents the zone name and class.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_QUERY_QUOTA_EXCCEEDED"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_QUERY_QUOTA_EXCCEEDED %1 client %2: request denied due to quota (%3)</span></dt><dd><p>
The xfr request was rejected because the server was already handling
the maximum number of allowable transfers as specified in the transfers_out
configuration parameter, which is also shown in the log message.  The
request was immediately responded and terminated with an RCODE of REFUSED.
This can happen for a busy xfrout server, and you may want to increase
this parameter; if the server is being too busy due to requests from
unexpected clients you may want to restrict the legitimate clients
with ACL.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_QUERY_REJECTED"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_QUERY_REJECTED %1 client %2: request to transfer %3 rejected</span></dt><dd><p>
The xfrout process rejected (by REFUSED rcode) a request to transfer zone to
given host. This is because of ACLs.  The %2 represents the IP
address and port of the peer requesting the transfer, and the %3
represents the zone name and class.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND shutdown command received</span></dt><dd><p>
The xfrout daemon received a shutdown command from the command channel

</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_RECEIVE_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_ERROR"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_RECEIVE_FILE_DESCRIPTOR_ERROR error receiving the file descriptor for an XFR connection</span></dt><dd><p>
There was an error receiving the file descriptor for the transfer
request from b10-auth.  There can be several reasons for this, but
the most likely cause is that b10-auth terminates for some reason
(maybe it's a bug of b10-auth, maybe it's an intentional restart by
the administrator), so depending on how this happens it may or may not
be a serious error.  But in any case this is not expected to happen
frequently, and it's advisable to figure out how this happened if
this message is logged.  Even if this error happens xfrout will reset
its internal state and will keep receiving further requests.  So
if it's just a temporary restart of b10-auth the administrator does
not have to do anything.

The unix socket file xfrout needs for contact with the auth daemon
already exists, and needs to be removed first, but there is a problem
removing it. It is likely that we do not have permission to remove
this file. The specific error is show in the log message. The xfrout
daemon will shut down.

the file. The reason for the failure is given in the error message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_SOCKET_SELECT_ERROR"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_SOCKET_SELECT_ERROR error while calling select() on request socket: %1</span></dt><dd><p>
There was an error while calling select() on the socket that informs
the xfrout daemon that a new xfrout request has arrived. This should
be a result of rare local error such as memory allocation failure and
shouldn't happen under normal conditions. The error is included in the
log message.
</p></dd><dt><a name="XFROUT_STARTED"></a><span class="term">XFROUT_STARTED xfrout started</span></dt><dd><p>

While starting up, the xfrout daemon tried to clear the unix domain
socket needed for contacting the b10-auth daemon to pass requests
on, but the file is in use. The most likely cause is that another
xfrout daemon process is still running. This xfrout daemon (the one
printing this message) will not start.

The most likely cause of this is that some low level error in the data
source, but it may also be other general (more unlikely) errors such
as memory shortage.  Some detail of the error is also included in the
message.  The xfrout server tries to return a SERVFAIL response in this case.

BIND10 system testing with Lettuce
or: to BDD or not to BDD

In this directory, we define a set of behavioral tests for BIND 10. Currently,
these tests are specific for BIND10, but we are keeping in mind that RFC-related
tests could be separated, so that we can test other systems as well.

Prerequisites:
- Installed version of BIND 10 (but see below how to run it from source tree)
- dig
- lettuce (http://lettuce.it)

To install lettuce, if you have the python pip installation tool, simply do
pip install lettuce
See http://lettuce.it/intro/install.html

Most systems have the pip tool in a separate package; on Debian-based systems
it is called python-pip. On FreeBSD the port is devel/py-pip.

Running the tests
-----------------

At this moment, we have a fixed port for local tests in our setups, port 47806.
This port must be free. (TODO: can we make this run-time discovered?).
Port 47805 is used for cmdctl, and must also be available.

The bind10 main script, bindctl script, and dig must all be in the default
search path of your environment.

To run the tests, just run 'lettuce' in this directory.

We have provided a script that sets up the shell environment to run the tests
with the build tree version of bind. If your shell uses export to set
environment variables, you can source the script setup_intree_bind10.sh, then
run lettuce.


Extending tests

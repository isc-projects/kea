// On some systems cppcheck produces false alarms about 'missing includes'.

// Please don't add any suppressions here. We now use inline
// suppressions (in the .cc files) so that we don't have to
// maintain line numbers in this file.

// See the cppcheck manual for syntax. It is something like:
//
//    // cppcheck-suppress duplicateExpression
//    EXPECT_FALSE(small_name < small_name);

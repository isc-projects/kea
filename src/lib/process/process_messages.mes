% DCTL_ALREADY_RUNNING %1 already running? %2
This is an error message that occurs when a module encounters a pre-existing
PID file which contains the PID of a running process.  This most likely
indicates an attempt to start a second instance of a module using the
same configuration file.  It is possible, though unlikely, that the PID file
is a remnant left behind by a server crash or power failure and the PID
it contains refers to a process other than Kea process.  In such an event,
it would be necessary to manually remove the PID file.  The first argument is
the process name, the second contains the PID and PID file.

% DCTL_CFG_FILE_RELOAD_ERROR configuration reload failed: %1, reverting to current configuration.
This is an error message indicating that the application attempted to reload
its configuration from file and encountered an error.  This is likely due to
invalid content in the configuration file.  The application should continue
to operate under its current configuration.

% DCTL_CFG_FILE_RELOAD_SIGNAL_RECVD OS signal %1 received, reloading configuration from file: %2
This is an informational message indicating the application has received a signal
instructing it to reload its configuration from file.

% DCTL_CONFIG_CHECK_COMPLETE server has completed configuration check: %1, result: %2
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration check is complete. The result of that check is printed.
This informational message is printed when configuration check is requested.

% DCTL_CONFIG_COMPLETE server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. It is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DCTL_CONFIG_DEPRECATED server configuration includes a deprecated object: %1
This error message is issued when the configuration includes a deprecated
object (i.e. a top level element) which will be ignored.

% DCTL_CONFIG_FETCH Fetching configuration data from config backends.
This is an informational message emitted when the Kea server is about to begin
retrieving configuration data from one or more configuration backends.

% DCTL_CONFIG_FILE_LOAD_FAIL %1 reason: %2
This fatal error message indicates that the application attempted to load its
initial configuration from file and has failed. The service will exit.

% DCTL_CONFIG_START parsing new configuration: %1
Logged at debug log level 10.
A debug message indicating that the application process has received an
updated configuration and has passed it to its configuration manager
for parsing.

% DCTL_DB_OPEN_CONNECTION_WITH_RETRY_FAILED Failed to connect to database: %1 with error: %2
This is an informational message issued when the server failed to connect to
the configuration database. The operation started a retry to connect procedure.
The database access string with password redacted is logged, along with the
error and details for the reconnect procedure.

% DCTL_DEPRECATED_OUTPUT_OPTIONS The output_options parameter is deprecated. Use output-options parameter instead.
This warning message is displayed when deprecated output_options is used instead
of output-options.

% DCTL_DEVELOPMENT_VERSION This software is a development branch of Kea. It is not recommended for production use.
This warning message is displayed when the version is a development
(vs stable) one: the second number of the version is odd.

% DCTL_INIT_PROCESS %1 initializing the application
Logged at debug log level 0.
This debug message is issued just before the controller attempts
to create and initialize its application instance.

% DCTL_INIT_PROCESS_FAIL %1 application initialization failed: %2
This error message is issued if the controller could not initialize the
application and will exit.

% DCTL_NOT_RUNNING %1 application instance is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
application when it is not running.

% DCTL_OPEN_CONFIG_DB Opening configuration database: %1
This message is printed when the Kea server is attempting to open a
configuration database.  The database access string with password redacted
is logged.

% DCTL_PARSER_FAIL Parser error: %1
On receipt of a new configuration, the server failed to create a parser to
decode the contents of the named configuration element, or the creation
succeeded but the parsing actions and committal of changes failed.
The reason for the failure is given in the message.

% DCTL_PID_FILE_ERROR %1 could not create a PID file: %2
This is an error message that occurs when the server is unable to create
its PID file.  The log message should contain details sufficient to
determine the underlying cause.  The most likely culprits are that
some portion of the pathname does not exist or a permissions issue. The
default path is determined by --localstatedir and --prefix meson setup options
but may be overridden by setting environment variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.
The first argument is the process name.

% DCTL_PROCESS_FAILED %1 application execution failed: %2
The controller has encountered a fatal error while running the
application and is terminating. The reason for the failure is
included in the message.

% DCTL_RUN_PROCESS %1 starting application event loop
Logged at debug log level 0.
This debug message is issued just before the controller invokes
the application run method.

% DCTL_SHUTDOWN %1 has shut down, pid: %2, version: %3
Logged at debug log level 0.
This is an informational message indicating that the service has shut
down. The argument specifies a name of the service.

% DCTL_SHUTDOWN_SIGNAL_RECVD OS signal %1 received, starting shutdown
Logged at debug log level 0.
This is a debug message indicating the application has received a signal
instructing it to shutdown.

% DCTL_STANDALONE %1 skipping message queue, running standalone
Logged at debug log level 0.
This is a debug message indicating that the controller is running in the
application in standalone mode. This means it will not connected to the Kea
message queue. Standalone mode is only useful during program development,
and should not be used in a production environment.

% DCTL_STARTING %1 starting, pid: %2, version: %3 (%4)
This is an informational message issued when controller for the
service first starts. Version is also reported.

% DCTL_UNLOAD_LIBRARIES_ERROR error unloading hooks libraries during shutdown: %1
This error message indicates that during shutdown, unloading hooks
libraries failed to close them. If the list of libraries is empty it is
a programmatic error in the server code. If it is not empty it could be
a programmatic error in one of the hooks libraries which could lead to
a crash during finalization.

% DCTL_UNSUPPORTED_SIGNAL ignoring reception of unsupported signal: %1
This is a debug message indicating that the application received an
unsupported signal.  This is a programming error indicating that the
application has registered to receive the signal but no associated
processing logic has been added.

# This script performs the first IXFR-IN test.  A BIND 9 nameserver (the
# "server") contains a version of the zone (version N) and three previous
# versions, N-2, N-4 and N-6.  A BIND 10 nameserver (the "client") is loaded
# with version N-6 of the zone.  A NOTIFY is sent to it, and it is expected that
# it will send an IXFR to the server and update itself with the latest version
# of the zone.  (The changes are such that the update will have to take place
# over TCP.)

. ../ixfr_init.sh

# On entry, the IXFR server is at version N-6.  The common tests assume that
# it is an N-4, so update it.

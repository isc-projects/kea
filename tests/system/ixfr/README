The directories in-1 to in-4 implement the following tests:

in-1: Check that BIND 10 can receive IXFR in a single UDP packet.
in-2: Check that BIND 10 can receive IXFR via TCP.
in-3: Check that BIND 10 will request AXFR if the server does not support IXFR.
in-4: Check that BIND 10 will request IXFR when its SOA refresh times out

The tests are described more fully in the document:

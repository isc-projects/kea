/// \page DataScrubbing Data Scrubbing
/// \section DataScrubbingIntro Introduction
/// When a response is received from an authoritative server, it should be
/// checked to ensure that the data contained in it is valid.  Signed data is
/// not a problem - validating the signatures is a sufficient check.  But
/// unsigned data in a response is more of a problem. (Note that even data from
/// signed zones may be not be signed, e.g. delegations are not signed.) In
/// particular, how do we know that the server from which the response was
/// received was authoritive for the data it returned?
///
/// The part of the code that checks for this is the "Data Scrubbing" module.
/// Although it includes the checking of IP addresses and ports, it is called
/// "Scrubbing" because it "scrubs" the returned message and removes doubtful
/// information.
///
/// \section DataScrubbingBasic Basic Checks
/// The first part - how do we know that the response comes from the correct
/// server - is relatively trivial, albeit not foolproof (which is why DNSSEC
/// was developed).  The following are checked:
///
/// - The IP address from which the response was received is the same as the
///   one to which the query was sent.
/// - The port on which the response was received is the same as the one from
///   which the query was sent.
///
/// (These tests need not not done for a TCP connection - if data is received
/// over the TCP stream, it is assumed that it comes from the address and port
/// to which a connection was made.)
///
/// - The protocol used to send the question is the same as the protocol on
///   which an answer was received.
///
/// (Strictly speaking, if this check fails it is a programming error - the
/// code should not mix up UPD and TCP messages.)
///
/// - The QID in the response message is the same as the QID in the query
///   message sent.
///
/// If the conditions are met, then the data - in all three response sections -
/// is scanned and out of bailiwick data is removed ("scrubbed").
///
/// \section DataScrubbingBailiwick Bailiwick
/// Bailiwick means "district or jurisdiction of bailie or bailiff" (Concise
/// Oxford Dictionary, 7th Edition).  It is not a term mentioned in any RFC
/// (or at least, any RFC up to RFC 5997) but is widely used in DNS literature.
/// In this context it is taken to mean the data for which a DNS server has
/// authority.  So when we speak of the information being "in bailiwick", we
/// mean that the the server is the ultimate source of authority for that data.
///
/// In practice, determining this from the response alone is difficult.  In
/// particular, as a server may be authoritative for many zones, it could in
/// theory be authoritative for any combination of RRsets that appear in a
/// response.
///
/// For this reason, bailiwick is dependent on the query.  If, for example, a
/// query for www.example.com is sent to the nameservers for example.com
/// (because of a referral of from the com. servers), the bailiwick for the
/// query is example.com.  This means that any information returned on domains
/// other than example.com may not be authoritative.  More exactly, it may be
/// authoritative (because the server is also authoritative for the zone
/// concerned), but based on the information available (in this example, that
/// the response originated from a nameserver for the zone example.com) it is
/// not possible to be certain.
///
/// Ideally, out of bailiwick data should be excluded from further processing
/// as it may be incorrect and corrupt the cache.  In practice, there are
/// two cases to consider:
///
/// The first is when the data has a qname that is not example.com or a
/// subdomain of it (e.g. xyz.com, www.example.net).  In this case the data can
/// be retrieved by an independent query - no path from the root zone to the
/// data goes through the current bailiwick, so there is no chance of ending up
/// in a loop.  In this case, data that appears to be out of bailiwick can be
/// dropped from the response.
///
/// The second case is when the QNAME of the data is a subdomain of the
/// bailiwick.  Here the server may or may not be authoritative for the data.
/// For example, if the name queried for were www.sub.example.com and the
/// example.com nameservers supplied an answer:
///
/// - The answer could be authoritative - www.sub.example.com could be
///   in the example.com zone.
/// - The answer might not be authoritative - the zone sub.example.com may have
///   been delegated, so the authoritative answer should come from
///   sub.example.com's nameservers.
/// - The answer might be authoritative even though zone sub.example.com has
///   been delegated, because the nameserver for example.com is the same as
///   that for sub.example.com.
///
/// Unlike the previous case, it is not possible to err on the side of caution
/// and drop such data.  Any independent query for it will pass through the
/// current bailiwick and the same question will be asked again.  For this
/// reason, any data in the response that has a QNAME equal to a subdomain of
/// the bailiwick has to be accepted.
///
/// In summary then, data in a response that has a QNAME equal to or a subdomain
/// of the bailiwick is considered in-bailiwick.  Anything else is out of of
/// bailiwick.
///
/// \subsection DataScrubbingCrossSection Cross-Section Scrubbing
/// Even with the bailiwick checks above, there are some additional cleaning
/// that can be done with the packet.  In particular:
///
/// - The QNAMEs of the RRsets in the authority section must be equal to or
///   superdomains of a QNAME of an RRset in the answer.  Any that are not
///   should be removed.
/// - If there is no answer section, the QNAMES of RRsets in the authority
///   section must be equal to or superdomains of the QNAME of the RRset in the
///   question.
///
/// Although previous checks should have removed some inconsistencies, it
/// will not trap obscure cases (e.g. bailiwick: "example.com", answer:
/// "www.example.com", authority: sub.example.com).  These checks do just that.
///
/// (Note that not included here is QNAME of question not equal to or a
/// superdomain of the answer; that check is made in the ResponseClassifier
/// class.)
///
/// \section DataScrubbingExample Examples
/// Some examples should make this clear: they all use the notation
/// Qu = Question, Zo = Zone being queried, An = Answer, Au = Authority,
/// Ad = Additional.
///
/// \subsection DataScrubbingEx1 Example 1: Simple Query
/// Querying a nameserver for the zone "example.com" for www.example.com and
/// receiving the answer "www.example.com A 1.2.3.4" with two nameservers quoted
/// as authority and both their addresses in the additional section:
///
/// Qu: www.example.com\n
/// Zo: example.com
///
/// An: www.example.com A 192.0.2.1
///
/// Au(1): example.com NS ns0.example.com\n
/// Au(2): example.com NS ns1.example.net
///
/// Ad(1): ns0.example.com A 192.0.2.100\n
/// Ad(2): ns1.example.net A 192.0.2.200
///
/// This answer could be returned by a properly configured server.  All resource
/// records in the answer - with the exception of Ad(2) - are in bailiwick
/// because the QNAME is equal to or a subdomain of the zone being queried.
///
/// It is permissible for Ad(2) to be returned by a properly configured server
/// as a hint to resolvers.  However the example.com nameservers are not
/// authoritative for addresses of domains in example.net; that record could
/// be out of date or incorrect.  Indeed, it might even be a deliberate attempt
/// at a spoof by getting us to cache an invalid address for ns1.example.net.
/// The safest thing to do is to drop the A record and to get the address of
/// ns1.example.net by querying for that name through the .net nameservers.
///
/// \subsection DataScrubbingEx2 Example 2: Multiple Zones on Same Nameserver
/// Assume now that example.com and sub.example.com are hosted on the same
/// nameserver and that from the .com zone the resolver has received a referral
/// to example.com.  Suppose that the query is for www.sub.example.com and that
/// the following response is received:
///
/// Qu: www.sub.example.com\n
/// Zo: example.com
///
/// An: (nothing)
///
/// Au(1): sub.example.com NS ns0.sub.example.com\n
/// Au(2): sub.example.com NS ns1.example.net
///
/// Ad(1): ns0.sub.example.com A 192.0.2.101\n
/// Ad(2): ns1.example.net A 192.0.2.201
///
/// Although we asked the example.com nameservers for information, we got the
/// nameservers for sub.example.com in the authority section.  This is valid
/// because if BIND-10 hosts multiple zones, it will look up the data in the
/// zone that most closely matches the query.
///
/// Using the criteria above, the data in the additional section can therefore
/// be regarded as in bailiwick because sub.example.com is a subdomain of
/// example.com.  As before though, the address for ns1.example.net in the
/// additional section is not in bailiwick because ns1.example.net is now a
/// subdomain of example.com.
///
/// \subsection DataScrubbingEx3 Example 3: Deliberate Spoof Attempt
/// Qu: www.example.com\n
/// Zo: example.com
///
/// An: www.example.com A 192.0.2.1
///
/// Au(1): com NS ns0.example.com\n
/// Au(2): com NS ns1.example.net
///
/// Ad(1): ns0.example.com A 192.0.2.100\n
/// Ad(2): ns1.example.net A 192.0.2.200
///
/// This is a deliberately invalid response.  The query is being sent to the
/// nameservers for example.com (presumably because a referral to example.com
/// was received from the com nameservers), but the response is an attempt
/// to get the specified nameservers cached as the nameservers for com - for
/// which example.com is not authoritative.
///
/// Note though that this response is only invalid because, due to the previous
/// referral, the query was sent to the example.com nameservers.  Had the
/// referral been to the com nameservers, it would be a valid response; the com
/// zone could well be serving all the data for example.com.  Having said that,
/// the A record for ns1.example.net would still be regarded as being out of
/// bailiwick becase the nameserver is not authoritative for the .net zone.
///
/// \subsection DataScrubbingEx4 Example 4: Inconsistent Answer Section
/// Qu: www.example.com\n
/// Zo: example.com
///
/// An: www.example.com A 192.0.2.1
///
/// Au(1): alpha.example.com NS ns0.example.com\n
/// Au(2): alpha.example.com NS ns1.example.net
///
/// Ad(1): ns0.example.com A 192.0.2.100\n
/// Ad(2): ns1.example.net A 192.0.2.200
///
/// Here, everything in the answer and authority sections is in bailiwick for
/// the example.com server. And although the zone example.com was queried, it
/// is permissible for the authority section to contain nameservers with a
/// qname that is a subdomain of example.com (e.g. see \ref DataScrubbingEx2).
/// However, only servers with a qname that is equal to or a superdomain of
/// the answer are authoritative for the answer.  So in this case, both
/// Au(1) and Au(2) (as well as Ad(2), for reasons given earlier) will be
/// scrubbed.

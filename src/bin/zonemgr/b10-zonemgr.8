.SH "NAME"
b10-zonemgr \- BIND 10 Secondary zone manager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-\-verbose\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR
daemon, also known as the BIND 10 secondary manager, keeps track of timers and other information necessary for BIND 10 to act as a DNS slave\&. Normally it is started by the
\fBbind10\fR(8)
boss process\&.
.PP
This daemon communicates with BIND 10 over a
\fBb10-msgq\fR(8)
C\-Channel connection\&. If this connection is not established,
\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR
will exit\&.
.PP

\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR
receives its configurations from
\fBb10-cfgmgr\fR(8)\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The configuration commands are:
.PP

\fBnotify\fR
(sent by
\fBb10-auth\fR(8)) tells
\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR
the zone name and class, and the IP address for the master (source of the NOTIFY message)\&. This will set the zone\'s refresh time to now\&.
This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
exits
\fBb10\-zonemgr\fR\&. (Note that the BIND 10 boss process will restart this service\&.)
.PP

\fBzone_new_data_ready\fR
is sent from
\fBb10-xfrin\fR(8)
to indicate that the zone transferred in successfully\&. This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.
.PP

\fBzone_xfrin_failed\fR
is sent from
\fBb10-xfrin\fR(8)
to indicate a failure (such as a transfer\-in was incomplete)\&. The refresh timer for the zone is reset\&.
This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.

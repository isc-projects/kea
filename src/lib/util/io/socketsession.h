/// \page SocketSessionUtility Socket session utility
///
/// This utility defines a set of classes that support forwarding a
/// "socket session" from one process to another.  A socket session is a
/// conceptual tuple of the following elements:
/// - A network socket
/// - The local and remote endpoints of a (IP) communication taking place on
///   the socket.  In practice an endpoint is a pair of an IP address and
///   TCP or UDP port number.
/// - Some amount of data sent from the remote endpoint and received on the
///   socket.  We call it (socket) session data in this documentation.
///
/// Note that this is a conceptual definition.  Depending on the underlying
/// implementation and/or the network protocol, some of the elements could be
/// part of others; for example, if it's an established TCP connection,
/// the local and remote endpoints would be able to be retrieved from the
/// socket using the standard \c getsockname() and \c getpeername() system
/// calls.  But in this definition we separate these to be more generic.
/// Also, as a matter of fact our intended usage includes non-connected UDP
/// communications, in which case at least the remote endpoint should be
/// provided separately from the socket.
///
/// In the actual implementation we represent a socket as a tuple of
/// socket's file descriptor, address family (e.g. \c AF_INET6),
/// socket type (e.g. \c SOCK_STREAM), and protocol (e.g. \c IPPROTO_TCP).
/// The latter three are included in the representation of a socket in order
/// to provide complete information of how the socket would be created
/// by the \c socket(2) system call.  More specifically in practice, these
/// parameters could be used to construct a Python socket object from the
/// file descriptor.
///
/// We use the standard \c sockaddr structure to represent endpoints.
///
/// Socket session data is an opaque memory region of an arbitrary length
/// (possibly with some reasonable upper limit).
///
/// To forward a socket session between processes, we use connected UNIX
/// domain sockets established between the processes.  The file descriptor
/// will be forwarded through the sockets as an ancillary data item of
/// type \c SCM_RIGHTS.  Other elements of the session will be transferred
/// as normal data over the connection.
///
/// We provide three classes to help applications forward socket sessions:
/// \c SocketSessionForwarder is the sender of the UNIX domain connection,
/// while \c SocketSessionReceiver is the receiver (this interface assumes
/// one direction of forwarding); \c SocketSession represents a single
/// socket session.
///
/// \c SocketSessionForwarder and \c SocketSessionReceiver objects use a
/// straightforward protocol to pass elements of socket sessions.
/// Once the connection is established, the forwarder object first forwards
/// the file descriptor with 1-byte dummy data.  It then forwards a
/// "(socket) session header", which contains all other elements of the session
/// except the file descriptor (already forwarded) and session data.
/// The wire format of the header is as follows:
/// - The length of the header (16-bit unsigned integer)
/// - Address family
/// - Socket type
/// - Protocol
/// - Size of the local endpoint in bytes
/// - Local endpoint (a copy of the memory image of the corresponding
///   \c sockaddr)
/// - Size of the remote endpoint in bytes
/// - Remote endpoint (same as local endpoint)
/// - Size of session data in bytes
///
/// The type of the fields is 32-bit unsigned integer unless explicitly
/// noted, and all fields are formatted in the network byte order.
///
/// The socket session data immediately follows the session header.
///
/// Note that the fields do not necessarily be in the network byte order
/// because they are expected to be exchanged on the same machine.  Likewise,
/// integer elements such as address family do not necessarily be represented
/// as an fixed-size value (i.e., 32-bit).  But fixed size fields are used
/// in order to ensure maximum portability in such a (rare) case where the
/// forwarder and the receiver are built with different compilers that have
/// different definitions of \c int.  Also, since \c sockaddr fields are
/// generally formatted in the network byte order, other fields are defined
/// so to be consistent.
///
/// One basic assumption in the API of this utility is socket sessions should
/// be forwarded without blocking, thus eliminating the need for incremental
/// read/write or blocking other important services such as responding to
/// requests from the application's clients.  This assumption should be held
/// as long as both the forwarder and receiver have sufficient resources
/// to handle the forwarding process since the communication is local.
/// But a forward attempt could still block if the receiver is busy (or even
/// hang up) and cannot keep up with the volume of incoming sessions.
///
/// So, in this implementation, the forwarder uses non blocking writes to
/// forward sessions.  If a write attempt could block, it immediately gives
/// up the operation with an exception.  The corresponding application is
/// expected to catch it, close the connection, and perform any necessary
/// recovery for that application (that would normally be re-establish the
/// connection with a new receiver, possibly after confirming the receiving
/// side is still alive).  On the other hand, the receiver implementation
/// assumes it's possible that it only receive incomplete elements of a
/// session (such as in the case where the forwarder writes part of the
/// entire session and gives up the connection).  The receiver implementation
/// throws an exception when it encounters an incomplete session.  Like the
/// case of the forwarder application, the receiver application is expected
/// to catch it, close the connection, and perform any necessary recovery
/// steps.
///
/// Note that the receiver implementation uses blocking read.  So it's
/// application's responsibility to ensure that there's at least some data
/// in the connection when the receiver object is requested to receive a
/// session (unless this operation can be blocking, e.g., by the use of
/// a separate thread).  Also, if the forwarder implementation or application
/// is malicious or extremely buggy and intentionally sends partial session
/// and keeps the connection, the receiver could block in receiving a session.
/// In general, we assume the forwarder doesn't do intentional blocking
/// as it's a local node and is generally a module of the same (BIND 10)
/// system.  The minimum requirement for the forwarder implementation (and
/// application) is to make sure the connection is closed once it detects
/// an error on it.  Even a naive implementation that simply dies due to
/// the exception will meet this requirement.

/// An exception indicating general errors that takes place in the
/// socket session related class objects.
///
/// In general the errors are unusual but possible failures such as unexpected
/// connection reset, and suggest the application to close the connection and
/// (if necessary) reestablish it.

/// @brief D2ClientMgr isolates Kea from the details of being a D2 client.
///
/// Provides services for managing the current dhcp-ddns configuration and
/// as well as communications with kea-dhcp-ddns.  Regarding configuration it
/// provides services to store, update, and access the current dhcp-ddns
/// configuration.  As for kea-dhcp-ddns communications, D2ClientMgr creates
/// maintains a NameChangeSender appropriate to the current configuration and
/// provides services to start, stop, and post NCRs to the sender.  Additionally
/// there are methods to examine the queue of requests currently waiting for
/// transmission.
///
/// The manager also provides the mechanics to integrate the ASIO-based IO
/// used by the NCR IPC with the select-driven IO used by Kea.  Senders expose
/// a file descriptor, the "select-fd" that can monitored for read-readiness
/// with the select() function (or variants).  D2ClientMgr provides a method,
/// runReadyIO(), that will instructs the sender to process the next ready
/// ready IO handler on the sender's IOservice.  Track# 3315 extended
/// Kea's IfaceMgr to support the registration of multiple external sockets
/// with callbacks that are then monitored with IO readiness via select().
/// D2ClientMgr registers the sender's select-fd and runReadyIO() with
/// IfaceMgr when entering the send mode and unregisters it when exiting send
/// mode.
///
/// To place the manager in send mode, the calling layer must supply an error
/// handler and optionally an IOService instance.  The error handler is invoked
/// if a send completes with a failed status. This provides the calling layer
/// an opportunity act upon the error.
///
/// If the caller supplies an IOService, that service will be used to process
/// the sender's IO.  If not supplied, D2ClientMgr pass a private IOService
/// into the sender.  Using a private service isolates the sender's IO from
/// any other services.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_IFACE listening on interface %1
An info message issued when a new interface is being added to the collection of
interfaces on which the server listens to DHCP messages.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_SUBNET4 adding subnet %1
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is adding the
specified IPv4 subnet to its database.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_SUBNET6 adding subnet %1
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is adding the
specified IPv6 subnet to its database.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ALL_IFACES_ACTIVE enabling listening on all interfaces
A debug message issued when the server is being configured to listen on all
interfaces.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CFG_DHCP_DDNS Setting DHCP-DDNS configuration to: %1
A debug message issued when the server's DHCP-DDNS settings are changed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CLEAR_ACTIVE_IFACES stop listening on all interfaces
A debug message issued when configuration manager clears the internal list
of active interfaces. This doesn't prevent the server from listening to
the DHCP traffic through open sockets, but will rather be used by Interface
Manager to select active interfaces when sockets are re-opened.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CONFIGURE_SERVERID server configuration includes specification of a server identifier
This warning message is issued when the server specified configuration of
a server identifier. If this new configuration overrides an existing
server identifier, this will affect existing bindings of the clients.
Clients will use old server identifier when they renew their bindings.
The server will not respond to those renews, and the clients will
eventually transition to rebinding state. The server should reassign
existing bindings and the clients will subsequently use new server
identifier. It is recommended to not modify the server identifier, unless
there is a good reason for it, to avoid increased number of renewals and
a need for rebinding (increase of multicast traffic, which may be received
by multiple servers).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DEL_SUBNET4 IPv4 subnet %1 removed
This debug message is issued when a subnet is successfully removed from the
server configuration. The argument identifies the subnet removed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DEL_SUBNET6 IPv6 subnet %1 removed
This debug message is issued when a subnet is successfully removed from the

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NEW_SUBNET4 a new subnet has been added to configuration: %1

been extended to include the specified subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NO_SUBNET4 no suitable subnet is defined for address hint %1
This debug message is output when the DHCP configuration manager has received
a request for an IPv4 subnet for the specified address, but no such
subnet exists.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NO_SUBNET6 no suitable subnet is defined for address hint %1
This debug message is output when the DHCP configuration manager has received
a request for an IPv6 subnet for the specified address, but no such
subnet exists.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ONLY_SUBNET4 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv4 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ONLY_SUBNET6 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv6 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options with the
same option code for the particular subnet. Adding multiple options is uncommon
for DHCPv6, but it is not prohibited.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_RELAY_IP_ADDRESS_DEPRECATED "relay" uses "ip-address", which has been deprecated, please use "ip-addresses": %1
This is debug message issued when the "relay" element being parse
contains "ip-address" rather than its replacement, "ip-addresses".
The server will still honor the value but users are encouraged to
move to the new list parameter.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_RAW_UNSUPPORTED use of raw sockets is unsupported on this OS, UDP sockets will be used
This warning message is logged when the user specified that the
DHCPv4 server should use the raw sockets to receive the DHCP
messages and respond to the clients, but the use of raw sockets
is not supported on the particular environment. The raw sockets
are useful when the server must respond to the directly connected
clients which don't have an address yet. If the raw sockets are
not supported by Kea on the particular platform, Kea will fall
back to use of the IP/UDP sockets. The responses to
the directly connected clients will be broadcast. The responses
to relayed clients will be unicast as usual.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_TYPE_DEFAULT "dhcp-socket-type" not specified , using default socket type %1
This informational message is logged when the administrator hasn't
specified the "dhcp-socket-type" parameter in configuration for interfaces.
In such case, the default socket type will be used.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_TYPE_SELECT using socket type %1
This informational message is logged when the DHCPv4 server selects the
socket type to be used for all sockets that will be opened on the
interfaces. Typically, the socket type is specified by the server
administrator. If the socket type hasn't been specified, the raw
socket will be selected. If the raw socket has been selected but
Kea doesn't support the use of raw sockets on the particular
OS, it will use an UDP socket instead.

This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_renew
or the lease6_rebind hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook
point, the setting of the flag by a callout instructs the server to not
extend the lifetime for a lease. If the client requested renewal of multiple
leases (by sending multiple IA options), the server will skip the renewal
of the one in question and will proceed with other renewals as usual.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_RECOVER_SKIP DHCPv6 lease %1 was not recovered from declined state because a callout set the skip status.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_recover
hook point set the next step status to SKIP. For this particular hook point, this
indicates that the server should not recover the lease from declined state.
The server will leave the lease as it is, in the declined state. The
server will attempt to recover it the next time decline recovery procedure
takes place.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_SELECT_SKIP Lease6 (non-temporary) creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_select
hook point sets the skip flag. It means that the server was told that
no lease6 should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its
database and the client will get a NoAddrsAvail for that IA_NA option.

% DHCPSRV_INVALID_ACCESS invalid database access string: %1

Socket creator API
==================

This API is between Boss and other modules to allow them requesting of sockets.
For simplicity, we will use the socket creator for all (even non-privileged)
ports for now, but we should have some function where we can abstract it later.

Goals
-----
* Be able to request a socket of any combination IPv4/IPv6 UDP/TCP bound to given
  port and address (sockets that are not bound to anything can be created
  without privileges, therefore are not requested from the socket creator).
* Allow to provide the same socket to multiple modules (eg. multiple running
  auth servers).
* Allow releasing the sockets (in case all modules using it give it up,
  terminate or crash).
* Allow restricting of the sharing (don't allow shared socket between auth
  and recursive, as the packets would often get to the wrong application,
  show error instead).
* Get the socket to the application.

Transport of sockets
--------------------
It seems we are stuck with current msgq for a while and there's a chance the
new replacement will not be able to send sockets inbound. So, we need another
channel.

The boss will create a unix-domain socket and listen on it. When something
requests a socket over the command channel and the socket is created, some kind
of token is returned to the application (which will represent the future
socket). The application then connects to the unix-domain socket, sends the
token over the connection (so Boss will know which socket to send there, in case
multiple applications ask for sockets simultaneously) and Boss sends the socket
in return.

Caching of sockets
------------------
To allow sending the same socket to multiple application, the Boss process will
hold a cache. Each socket that is created and sent is kept open in Boss and
preserved there as well. A reference count is kept with each of them.

When another application asks for the same socket, it is simply sent from the
cache instead of creating it again by the creator.

When application gives the socket willingly (by sending a message over the
command channel), the reference count can be decreased without problems. But
when the application terminates or crashes, we need to decrease it as well.
There's a problem, since we don't know which command channel connection (eg.
lname) belongs to which PID. Furthermore, the applications don't need to be
started by boss.

There are two possibilities:
* Let the msgq send messages about disconnected clients (eg. group message to
  some name). This one is better if we want to migrate to dbus, since dbus
  already has this capability as well as sending the sockets inbound (at least it
  seems so on unix) and we could get rid of the unix-domain socket completely.
* Keep the unix-domain connections open forever. Boss can remember which socket
  was sent to which connection and when the connection closes (because the
  application crashed), it can drop all the references on the sockets. This
  seems easier to implement.

The commands
------------
* Command to release a socket. This one would have single parameter, the token
  used to get the socket. After this, boss would decrease its reference count
  and if it drops to zero, close its own copy of the socket. This should be used
  when the module stops using the socket (and after closes it).
* Command to request a socket. It would have parameters to specify which socket
  (IP address, address family, port) and how to allow sharing. Sharing would be
  one of:
  - None
  - Same kind of application
  - Any kind of application
  And a kind of application would be provided, to decide if the sharing is
  possible (eg. if auth allows sharing with the same kind and something else
  allows sharing with anything, the sharing is not possible, two auths can).

  It would return either error (the socket can't be created or sharing is not
  possible) or the token. Then there would be some time for the application to
  pick up the requested socket.

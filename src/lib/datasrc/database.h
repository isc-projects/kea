///
/// This class is defines interface to databases. Each supported database
/// will provide methods for accessing the data stored there in a generic
/// manner. The methods are meant to be low-level, without much or any knowledge
/// about DNS and should be possible to translate directly to queries.
///
/// On the other hand, how the communication with database is done and in what
/// schema (in case of relational/SQL database) is up to the concrete classes.
///
/// This class is non-copyable, as copying connections to database makes little
/// sense and will not be needed.
///
/// \todo Is it true this does not need to be copied? For example the zone
///     iterator might need it's own copy. But a virtual clone() method might
///     be better for that than copy constructor.
///
/// \note The same application may create multiple connections to the same
///     database, having multiple instances of this class. If the database
///     allows having multiple open queries at one connection, the connection
///     class may share it.

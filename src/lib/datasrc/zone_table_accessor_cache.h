/// \brief A \c ZoneTableAccessor implementation for in-memory cache.
///
/// This class implements the \c ZoneTableAccessor interface for in-memory
/// cache.  Its conceptual table consists of the zones that are specified
/// to be loaded into memory in configuration.  Note that these zones
/// may or may not actually be loaded in memory.  In fact, this class object
/// is intended to be used by applications that load these zones into memory,
/// so that the application can get a list of zones to be loaded.  Also, even
/// after loading, some zone may still not be loaded, e.g., due to an error
/// in the corresponding zone file.
///
/// An object of this class is expected to be returned by
/// \c ConfigurableClientList.  Normal applications shouldn't instantiate
/// this class directly.  It's still defined to be publicly visible for
/// testing purposes but, to clarify the intent, it's hidden in the
/// "internal" namespace.

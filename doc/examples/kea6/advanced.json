# This is an example configuration file for DHCPv6 server in Kea.
# It attempts to showcase some of the more advanced features.
# Topology wise, it's a basic scenario with one IPv6 subnet configured.
# It is assumed that one subnet (2001:db8:1::/64) is available directly
# over eth0 interface.

{
# Kea is told to listen on eth0 interface only.
  "interfaces": [ "eth0" ],

# We need to specify lease type. As of May 2014, three backends are supported:
# memfile, mysql and pgsql. We'll just use memfile, because it doesn't require
# any prior set up.

# Kea 0.9.1 introduced MAC/hardware addresses support in DHCPv6. There is
# no single reliable method of getting MAC address information in DHCPv6.
# Kea supports several methods. Depending on your network set up, some
# methods may be more preferable than others, hence the configuration
# parameter. 'mac-sources' is a list of methods. Allowed parameters are:
# any, raw, duid, ipv6-link-local, client-link-addr-option, rfc6939 (which
# is an alias for client-link-addr-option), remote-id, rfc4649 (which is an
# alias for remote-id, subscriber-id, rfc4580 (which is an alias for
# subscriber-id) and docsis.
#
# If mac-sources are not specified, a default value of 'any' is used.
  "mac-sources": [ "client-link-addr-option", "duid", "ipv6-link-local" ],

# Addresses will be assigned with preferred and valid lifetimes
# being 3000 and 4000, respectively. Client is told to start
# renewing after 1000 seconds. If the server does not repond
# after 2000 seconds since the lease was granted, client is supposed
# to start REBIND procedure (emergency renewal that allows switching
# to a different server).

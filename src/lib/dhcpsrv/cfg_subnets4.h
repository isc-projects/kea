    /// specified for all subnets. If the relay address for the subnet is equal
    /// to the address of the relay through which the message was transmitted,
    /// the particular subnet is returned.
    ///
    /// If the giaddr is not matched with any of the relay addresses in any
    /// subnet or the message was not relayed, the method will need to try to
    /// match one of the addresses in the client's message with the prefixes
    /// of the existing subnets. Depending whether it is a relayed message,
    /// message from the renewing client or a new allocation, the server will
    /// pick one of the following addresses for this matching:
    /// - giaddr - for relayed message
    /// - ciaddr - for renewing or rebinding client
    /// - source address - for the renewing client which didn't provide ciaddr

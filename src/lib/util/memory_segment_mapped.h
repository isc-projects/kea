/// \brief Mapped-file based Memory Segment class.
///
/// This implementation of \c MemorySegment uses a concrete file to be mapped
/// into memory.  Multiple processes can share the same mapped memory image.
///
/// This class provides two operation modes: read-only and read-write.
/// A \c MemorySegmentMapped object in the read-only mode cannot modify the
/// mapped memory image or other internal maintenance data of the object;
/// In the read-write mode the object can allocate or deallocate memory
/// from the mapped image, and the owner process can change the content.
///
/// Multiple processes can open multiple segments for the same file in
/// read-only mode at the same time.  But there shouldn't be more than
/// one process that opens segments for the same file in read-write mode
/// at the same time.  Likewise, if one process opens a segment for a file
/// there shouldn't be any other process that opens a segment for the file
/// in read-only mode.  This class tries to detect any violation of this
/// restriction, but this does not intend to provide 100% safety.  It's
/// generally the user's responsibility to ensure this condition.
///
/// The same restriction applies within the single process, whether
/// multi-threaded or not: a process shouldn't open read-only and read-write
/// (or multiple read-write) segments for the same file.  The violation
/// detection mentioned above may or may not work in such cases due to
/// limitation of the underlying API.  It's completely user's responsibility
/// to prevent this from happening.  A single process may open multiple
/// segments in read-only mode for the same file, but that shouldn't be
/// necessary in practice; since it's read-only there wouldn't be a reason
/// to have a redundant copy.

    ///   exist, a new one will be created.  An existing file will be used
    ///   any initial modification.

/// @brief DHCPv6 client used for unit testing.
///
/// This class implements a DHCPv6 "client" which interoperates with the
/// @c NakedDhcpv6Srv class. It calls @c NakedDhcpv6Srv::fakeRecive to
/// deliver client messages to the server for processing. The server places
/// the response in the @c NakedDhcpv6Srv::fake_sent_ container. The client
/// pops messages from this container which simulates reception of the
/// response from the server.
///
/// The client maintains the leases it acquired from the server. If it has
/// acquired the lease as a result of SARR exchange, it will use this lease
/// when the Rebind process is triggered by the unit test.
///
/// The client exposes a set of functions which simulate different exchange
/// types between the client and the server. It also provides the access to
/// the objects encapsulating responses from the server so as it is possible
/// to verify from the unit test that the server's response is correct.
///
/// @todo This class has been implemented to simplify the structure of the
/// unit test and to make unit tests code self-explanatory. Currently,
/// this class is mostly used by the unit tests which test Rebind processing
/// logic. At some point we may want to use this class to test some other
/// message types, e.g. Renew, in which case it may need to be extended.
/// Also, once we implement the support for multiple IAAddr and IAPrefix
/// options within single IA, the logic which maintains leases will have
/// to be extended to support it.

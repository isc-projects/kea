This is the source for the development version of BIND 10.

BIND is the popular implementation of a DNS server, developer
interfaces, and DNS tools. BIND 10 is a rewrite of BIND 9. BIND 10
is written in C++ and Python and provides a modular environment
for serving, maintaining, and developing DNS.

BIND10-devel is new development leading up to the production
BIND 10 release. It contains prototype code and experimental
interfaces. Nevertheless it is ready to use now for testing the
new BIND 10 infrastructure ideas. The Year 3 goals of the five
year plan are described here:

        http://bind10.isc.org/wiki/Year3Goals

This release includes the bind10 master process, b10-msgq message
bus, b10-auth authoritative DNS server (with SQLite3 and in-memory
backends), b10-resolver recursive or forwarding DNS server, b10-cmdctl
remote control daemon, b10-cfgmgr configuration manager, b10-xfrin
AXFR inbound service, b10-xfrout outgoing AXFR service, b10-zonemgr
secondary manager, b10-stats statistics collection and reporting
daemon, b10-stats-httpd for HTTP access to XML-formatted stats,
b10-host DNS lookup utility, and a new libdns++ library for C++
with a python wrapper. BIND 10 also provides an experimental DHCPv6
echo server, b10-dhcp6.

/// specific values, such as: HTTP method, version, URI and headers.
///
/// The derivations of this class provide specializations and specify the
/// HTTP methods, versions and headers supported/required in the specific use
/// cases. For example, the @c PostHttpRequest class derives from @c HttpRequest
/// and it requires that request uses POST method. The @c PostHttpRequestJson,
/// which derives from @c PostHttpRequest requires that the POST message
/// includes body holding a JSON structure and provides methods to parse the
/// JSON body.

///  - the first commonName of the IssuerName of the client certificate
///  - the user ID of the basic HTTP authentication

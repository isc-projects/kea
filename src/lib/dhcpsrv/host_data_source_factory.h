/// This class comprises nothing but static methods used to create a host data
/// source object. It analyzes the database information passed to the creation
/// function and instantiates an appropriate host data source object based on
/// the type requested.
///
/// Strictly speaking these functions could be stand-alone functions.  However,
/// it is convenient to encapsulate them in a class for naming purposes.

    /// in the "name=value" format, separated by spaces.  The data MUST include

/// \brief The \c Question class encapsulates the common search key of DNS
/// lookup, consisting of owner name, RR type and RR class.
///
/// The primarily intended use case of this class is an entry of the question
/// section of DNS messages.
/// This could also be used as a general purpose lookup key, e.g., in a
/// custom implementation of DNS database.
///
/// In this initial implementation, the \c Question class is defined as
/// a <em>concrete class</em>; it's not expected to be inherited by
/// a user-defined customized class.
/// It may be worth noting that it's different from the design of the
/// RRset classes (\c AbstractRRset and its derived classes).
/// The RRset classes form an inheritance hierarchy from the base abstract
/// class.
/// This may look odd in that an "RRset" and "Question" are similar from the
/// protocol point of view: Both are used as a semantics unit of DNS messages;
/// both share the same set of components (name, RR type and RR class).
///
/// In fact, BIND9 didn't introduce a separate data structure for Questions,
/// and use the same \c "rdataset" structure for both RRsets and Questions.
/// We could take the same approach, but chose to adopt the different design.
/// One reason for that is because a Question and an RRset are still
/// different, and a Question might not be cleanly defined, e.g., if it were
/// a derived class of some "RRset-like" class.
/// For example, we couldn't give a reasonable semantics for \c %getTTL() or
/// \c %setTTL() methods for a Question, since it's not associated with the
/// TTL.
/// In fact, the BIND9 implementation ended up often separating the case where
/// a \c "rdataset" is from the Question section of a DNS message and the
/// case where it comes from other sections.
/// If we cannot treat them completely transparently anyway, separating the
/// class (type) would make more sense because we can exploit compilation
/// time type checks.
///
/// On the other hand, we do not expect a strong need for customizing the
/// \c Question class, unlike the RRset.
/// Handling the "Question" section of a DNS message is relatively a
/// simple work comparing to RRset-involved operations, so a unified
/// straightforward implementation should suffice for any use cases
/// including performance sensitive ones.
///
/// We may, however, still want to have a customized version of Question
/// for, e.g, highly optimized behavior, and may revisit this design choice
/// as we have more experience with this implementation.
///
/// One disadvantage of defining RRsets and Questions as unrelated classes
/// is that we cannot handle them in a polymorphic way.
/// For example, we might want to iterate over DNS message sections and
/// render the data in the wire format, whether it's an RRset or a Question.
/// If a \c Question were a derived class of some common RRset-like class,
/// we could do this by calling <code>rrset_or_question->%toWire()</code>.
/// But the actual design doesn't allow this approach, which may require
/// duplicate code for almost the same operation.
/// To mitigate this problem, we intentionally used the same names
/// with the same signature for some common methods of \c Question and
/// \c AbstractRRset such as \c %getName() or \c %toWire().
/// So the user class may use a template function that is applicable to both
/// \c Question and \c RRset to avoid writing duplicate code logic.

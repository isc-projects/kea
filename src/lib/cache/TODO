* Implement the TODO item for getRRsetTrustLevel() in message_entry.cc
    
  "TODO, according RFC2181 section 5.4.1, only the record 
   describing that ailas is necessarily authoritative."

* Implement dump/load/resize interfaces of rrset/message/recursor cache.   
* Once LRU hash table is implemented, it should be used by message/rrset cache.  
* Once the hash/lrulist related files in /lib/nsas is moved to seperated
  folder, the code of recursor cache has to be updated.

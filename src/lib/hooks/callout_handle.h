/// @brief Per-packet callout handle
///
/// An object of this class is associated with every packet (or request)
/// processed by the server.  It forms the principle means of passing data
/// between the server and the user-library callouts.
///
/// The class allows access to the following information:
///
/// - Arguments.  When the callouts associated with a hook are called, they
///   are passed information by the server (and can return information to it)
///   through name/value pairs.  Each of these pairs is an argument and the
///   information is accessed through the {get,set}Argument() methods.
///
/// - Per-packet context.  Each packet has a context associated with it, this
///   context being  on a per-library basis.  In other words, As a packet passes
///   through the callouts associated with a given library, the callouts can
///   associate and retrieve information with the packet.  The per-library
///   nature of the context means that the callouts within a given library can
///   pass packet-specific information between one another, but they cannot pass
///   information to callous within another library.  Typically such context
///   is created in the "context_create" callout and destroyed in the
///   "context_destroy" callout.  The information is accessed through the
///   {get,set}Context() methods.
///
/// - Per-library handle (LibraryHandle). The library handle allows the
///   callout to dynamically register and deregister callouts. In the latter
///   case, only functions registered by functions in the same library as the
///   callout doing the deregistration can be removed: callouts registered by
///   other libraries cannot be modified.

.SH "NAME"
b10-xfrin \- Incoming DNS zone transfer service
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-xfrin\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
daemon provides the BIND 10 incoming DNS zone transfer service\&. Normally it is started by the
\fBbind10\fR(8)
boss process\&. When triggered it can request and receive a zone transfer and store the zone in a BIND 10 zone data source\&.
.PP
The
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
daemon supports both AXFR and IXFR\&. Due to some implementation limitations of the current development release, however, it only tries AXFR by default, and care should be taken to enable IXFR\&. See the BIND 10 Guide for more details\&.
.PP
This daemon communicates with BIND 10 over a
\fBb10-msgq\fR(8)
C\-Channel connection\&. If this connection is not established,
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
will exit\&.
.PP

\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
receives its configurations from
\fBb10-cfgmgr\fR(8)\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The configurable settings are:
.PP
\fItransfers_in\fR
defines the maximum number of inbound zone transfers that can run concurrently\&. The default is 10\&.
.PP

\fIzones\fR
is a list of zones known to the
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
daemon\&. The list items are:
\fIname\fR
(the zone name),
\fIclass\fR
(defaults to
\(lqIN\(rq),
\fImaster_addr\fR
(the zone master to transfer from),
\fImaster_port\fR
(defaults to 53),
\fIuse_ixfr\fR
(defaults to false), and
\fItsig_key\fR
(optional TSIG key to use)\&. The
\fItsig_key\fR
is specified using a full string colon\-delimited name:key:algorithm representation (e\&.g\&.
\(lqfoo\&.example\&.org:EvABsfU2h7uofnmqaRCrhHunGsd=:hmac\-sha1\(rq)\&.
.PP
(The site\-wide
\fImaster_addr\fR
and
\fImaster_port\fR
configurations are deprecated; use the
\fIzones\fR
list configuration instead\&.)
.PP
The configuration commands are:
.PP

\fBnotify\fR
is sent by
\fBb10-zonemgr\fR(8)
when a DNS NOTIFY message is received to initiate a zone transfer\&.
This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.
.PP

\fBrefresh\fR
triggers the transfer in for a single zone\&. It is the same as
\fBretransfer\fR
except it checks the SOA serial first\&.
This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.

.PP

\fBrefresh_from_zonemgr\fR
is sent by
\fBb10-zonemgr\fR(8)
according to the SOA\'s REFRESH time to tell
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
that the zone needs to do a zone refresh\&. This is an internal command and not exposed to the administrator\&.
.PP

\fBretransfer\fR
triggers the transfer in for a single zone without checking the zone\'s serial number\&. It has the following arguments:
\fIzone_name\fR
to define the zone to request,
\fIzone_class\fR
to define the class (defaults to
\(lqIN\(rq),
\fImaster\fR
to define the IP address of the authoritative server to transfer from, and
\fIport\fR
to define the port number on the authoritative server (defaults to 53)\&. If the address or port is not specified, it will use the value previously defined in the
\fIzones\fR
configuration\&.
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
stops all incoming zone transfers and exits
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR\&. (Note that the BIND 10 boss process will restart this service\&.)

The
\fBb10\-xfrin\fR
daemon was implemented in March 2010 by Zhang Likun of CNNIC for the ISC BIND 10 project\&.

.SH "NAME"
b10-resolver \- Recursive DNS server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-resolver\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-resolver\fR [\fB\-v\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
daemon provides the BIND 10 recursive DNS server\&. Normally it is started by the
\fBbind10\fR(8)
boss process\&.
.PP
This daemon communicates with other BIND 10 components over a
\fBb10-msgq\fR(8)
C\-Channel connection\&. If this connection is not established,
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
will exit\&.
.PP
It also receives its configurations from
\fBb10-cfgmgr\fR(8)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose mode\&. This sets logging to the maximum debugging level\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The configurable settings are:
.PP

\fIforward_addresses\fR
defines the list of addresses and ports that
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
should forward queries to\&. Defining this enables forwarding\&.
.PP

\fIlisten_on\fR
is a list of addresses and ports for
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
to listen on\&. The list items are the
\fIaddress\fR
string and
\fIport\fR
number\&. The defaults are address ::1 port 53 and address 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 port 53\&.
.PP






\fIquery_acl\fR
is a list of query access control rules\&. The list items are the
\fIaction\fR
string and the
\fIfrom\fR
or
\fIkey\fR
strings\&. The possible actions are ACCEPT, REJECT and DROP\&. The
\fIfrom\fR
is a remote (source) IPv4 or IPv6 address or special keyword\&. The
\fIkey\fR
is a TSIG key name\&. The default configuration accepts queries from 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 and ::1\&.
.PP

\fIretries\fR
is the number of times to retry (resend query) after a query timeout (\fItimeout_query\fR)\&. The default is 3\&.
.PP

\fIroot_addresses\fR
is a list of addresses and ports for
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
to use directly as root servers to start resolving\&. The list items are the
\fIaddress\fR
string and
\fIport\fR
number\&. By default, a hardcoded address for l\&.root\-servers\&.net (199\&.7\&.83\&.42 or 2001:500:3::42) is used\&.
.PP

\fItimeout_client\fR
is the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out the incoming client query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 4000\&. After this timeout, a SERVFAIL is sent back to the client asking the question\&. (The lookup may continue after the timeout, but a later answer is not returned for the now\-past query\&.)
.PP

\fItimeout_lookup\fR
is the number of milliseconds before it stops trying the query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 30000\&.
.PP


\fItimeout_query\fR
is the number of milliseconds to wait before it retries a query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 2000\&.
.PP
The configuration command is:
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
exits
\fBb10\-resolver\fR\&. This has an optional
\fIpid\fR
argument to select the process ID to stop\&. (Note that the BIND 10 boss process may restart this service if configured\&.)

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
daemon was first coded in September 2010\&. The initial implementation only provided forwarding\&. Iteration was introduced in January 2011\&. Caching was implemented in February 2011\&. Access control was introduced in June 2011\&.

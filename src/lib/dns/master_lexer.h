/// (if it has a value) its value.  Essentially, the class provides
/// constructors corresponding to different types of tokens, and corresponding
/// getter methods.  The type and value are fixed at the time of construction
/// and will never be modified throughout the lifetime of the object.
/// The getter methods are still provided to maximize the safety; an
/// application cannot refer to a value that is invalid for the type of token.
///
/// This class is intentionally implemented as copyable and assignable
/// (using the default version of copy constructor and assignment operator),
/// but it's mainly for internal implementation convenience.  Applications will

/// data, and provides the user application with the actual data in a
/// more convenient form such as a std::string object.
///
/// In order to support the $INCLUDE notation, this class is designed to be
/// able to operate on multiple files or input streams in the nested way.
/// The \c pushSource() and \c popSource() methods correspond to the push
/// and pop operations.
///
/// While this class is public, it is less likely to be used by normal
/// applications; it's mainly expected to be used within this library,
/// specifically by the \c MasterLoader class and \c Rdata implementation
/// classes.
///
/// \note The error handling policy of this class is slightly different from
/// that of other classes of this library.  We generally throw an exception
/// for an invalid input, whether it's more likely to be a program error or
/// a "user error", which means an invalid input that comes from outside of
/// the library.  But, this class returns an error code for some certain
/// types of user errors instead of throwing an exception.  Such cases include
/// a syntax error identified by the lexer or a misspelled file name that
/// causes a system error at the time of open.  This is based on the assumption
/// that the main user of this class is a parser of master files, where
/// we want to give an option to ignore some non fatal errors and continue
/// the parsing.  This will be useful if it just performs overall error
/// checks on a master file.  When the (immediate) caller needs to do explicit
/// error handling, exceptions are not that a useful tool for error reporting
/// because we cannot separate the normal and error cases anyway, which would
/// be one major advantage when we use exceptions.  And, exceptions are
/// generally more expensive, either when it happens or just by being able
/// to handle with \c try and \c catch (depending on the underlying
/// implementation of the exception handling).  For these reasons, some of
/// this class does not throw for an error that would be reported as an
/// exception in other classes.

    /// expected token, calls the other version of \c getNextToken(Options),
    /// and returns the token if it's of the expected type (due to the usage
    /// assumption this should be normally the case).  There are some non
    /// trivial details though:
    ///
    /// - If the expected type is MasterToken::QSTRING, both quoted and
    ///   unquoted strings are recognized and returned.
    /// - If the optional \c eol_ok parameter is \c true (very rare case),
    ///   MasterToken::END_OF_LINE and MasterToken::END_OF_FILE are recognized
    ///   and returned if they are found instead of the expected type of
    ///   token.
    /// - If the next token is not of the expected type (including the case
    ///   a number is expected but it's out of range), ungetToken() is
    ///   internally called so the caller can re-read that token.
    /// - If other types or errors (such as unbalanced parentheses) are
    ///   detected, the erroneous part isn't "ungotten"; the caller can
    ///   continue parsing after that part.
    ///
    /// In some very rare cases where the RDATA has an optional trailing field,
    /// the \c eol_ok parameter would be set to \c true.  This way the caller
    /// can handle both cases (the field does or does not exist) by a single
    /// call to this method.  In all other cases \c eol_ok should be set to
    /// \c false, and that is the default and can be omitted.
    ///
    /// Unlike the other version of \c getNextToken(Options), this method
    /// throws an exception of type \c LexerError for non fatal errors such as
    /// broken syntax or encountering an unexpected type of token.  This way
    /// the caller can write RDATA parser code without bothering to handle
    /// errors for each field.  For example, pseudo parser code for MX RDATA
    /// would look like this:
    /// \code
    ///    const uint32_t pref =
    ///        lexer.getNextToken(MasterToken::NUMBER).getNumber();
    ///    // check if pref is the uint16_t range; no other check is needed.
    ///    const Name mx(lexer.getNextToken(MasterToken::STRING).getString());
    /// \endcode
    ///
    /// In the case where \c LexerError exception is thrown, it's expected
    /// to be handled comprehensively for the parser of the RDATA or at a
    /// higher layer.  The \c token_ member variable of the corresponding
    /// \c LexerError exception object stores a token of type
    /// \c MasterToken::ERROR that indicates the reason for the error.
    ///
    /// Due to the specific intended usage of this method, only a subset
    /// of \c MasterToken::Type values are acceptable for the \c expect
    /// parameter: \c MasterToken::STRING, \c MasterToken::QSTRING, and
    /// \c MasterToken::NUMBER.  Specifying other values will result in
    /// an \c InvalidParameter exception.
    ///
    /// \throw InvalidParameter The expected token type is not allowed for
    /// this method.
    /// \throw LexerError The lexer finds non fatal error or it finds an
    /// \throw other Anything the other version of getNextToken() can throw.
    ///
    /// \param expect Expected type of token.  Must be either STRING, QSTRING,
    /// or NUMBER.
    /// \param eol_ok \c true iff END_OF_LINE or END_OF_FILE is acceptable.
    /// \return The expected type of token.

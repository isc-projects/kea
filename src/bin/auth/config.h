/// The abstract base class that represents a single configuration identifier
/// for an \c AuthSrv object.
///
/// In general, each top level configuration identifier for \c AuthSrv is
/// expected to have its own derived class of this base class.
/// For example, for the following configuration:
/// \code { "param1": 10, "param2": { "subparam1": "foo", "subparam2": [] } }
/// \endcode
/// "param1" and "param2" are top level identifiers, and would correspond to
/// derived \c AuthConfigParser classes.
/// "subparam1" and/or "subparam2" may also have dedicated derived classes.
///
/// These derived classes are hidden inside the implementation; applications
/// are not expected to (and in fact cannot) instantiate them directly.
///
/// Each derived class is generally expected to be constructed with an
/// \c AuthSrv object to be configured and hold a reference to the server
/// throughout the configuration process.
/// For each derived class, the \c build() method parses the configuration
/// value for the corresponding identifier and prepares new configuration
/// value(s) to be applied to the server.  This method may throw an exception
/// when it encounters an error.
/// The \c commit() method actually applies the new configuration value
/// to the server.  It must not throw an exception.
///
/// When the destructor is called before \c commit(), the destructor is
/// supposed to make sure the state of the \c AuthSrv object is the same
/// as that before it starts building the configuration value.
/// If \c build() doesn't change the server state (which is recommended)
/// the destructor doesn't have to do anything special in this regard.
/// This is a key to ensure the strong exception guarantee (see also
/// the description of \c configureAuthServer()).

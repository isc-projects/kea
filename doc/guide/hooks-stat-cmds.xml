  <title>stat_cmds: Supplemental Statistics Commands</title>
  <para>
    This library provides additional statistics commands for
    retrieving lease statistics from Kea DHCP servers.  These commands
    were added to address an issue with obtaining accurate lease
    statistics in deployments running multiple Kea servers that use
    shared lease back end.  The in-memory statistics kept by individual
    servers only track lease changes made by that server.  Thus in a
    deployment with multiple servers (e.g. two kea-dhcp6 servers using the
    same PostgreSQL database for lease storage), these statistics are incomplete.
    In Kea 1.4, the MySQL and PostgreSQL back ends were modified to track
    lease allocation changes as they occur via database triggers. Additionally,
    all four lease back ends were extended to support retrieving lease
    statistics for all subnets, a single subnet, or a range of subnets.
    Finally, this library was constructed to provide commands for retrieving
    these statistics.  Additional statistics commands may be added to this
    library in future releases.

    <note>
      <para>This library may only be loaded by <command>kea-dhcp4</command>
      or <command>kea-dhcp6</command> process.

  </para>

  <para>
    The commands currently provided by this library are:
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><command>stat-lease4-get</command> - fetches DHCPv4 lease statistics</para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para><command>stat-lease6-get</command> - fetches DHCPv6 lease statistics</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    The Stat commands library is part of the open source code and is
    available to every Kea user.
  </para>

  <para>
    All commands use JSON syntax and can be issued either directly to
    the servers via the control channel (see <xref linkend="ctrl-channel"/>)
    or via Control Agent (see <xref linkend="kea-ctrl-agent"/>).
  </para>

  <para>
    This library may be loaded by both kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 servers.
    It is loaded in the same way as other libraries and currently has
    no parameters:

  <para>
    In a deployment with multiple Kea DHCP servers sharing a common lease
    storage, it may be loaded by any or all of the servers.  However, one
    thing to keep in mind is that a server's response to a stat-lease{4/6}-get
    command will only contain data for subnets known to that server.  In
    other words, if subnet does not appear in a server's configuration, it
    will not retrieve statistics for it.

  <title>stat-lease4-get, stat-lease6-get commands</title>
    <para id="command-stat-lease6-get">
      The <command>stat-lease4-get</command> and <command>stat-lease6-get</command>
      commands fetch lease statistics for a range of known subnets.  The
      range of subnets is determined through the use of optional command
      input parameters:
      <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>subnet-id</command> - ID of the subnet for which
            lease statistics should be fetched. Use this to get statistics for
            a single subnet.  If the subnet does not exist the command result
            code will be 3 (i.e. CONTROL_RESULT_EMPTY).
            </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><command>subnet-range</command> - A pair of subnet IDs which
            describe an inclusive range of subnets for which statistics should
            be retrieved.  Note that fuzzy values are supported thus allowing
            for a query for statistics using approximate ID values. If the
            range does not include any known subnets, the command result code
            will be 3 (i.e. CONTROL_RESULT_EMPTY).
            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><command>first-subnet-id</command> - ID of the first
                subnet in the range.</para>

              <listitem>

        The use of subnet-id and subnet-range are mutually exclusive.
        If no parameters are given, the result will contain data for all
        known subnets.  Note that in configurations with large numbers of
        subnets, this can be result in a large response.

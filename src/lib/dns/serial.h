/// catch; they should be compared using sequence space arithmetic.
/// So given that they are 32-bits; as soon as the difference between two
/// serial numbers is greater than 2147483647 (2^31 - 1), the lower number
/// (in plain comparison) is considered the higher one.

/// In order to do this as transparently as possible, these numbers are

/// In this specific context, these operations are called 'serial number
/// arithmetic', and they are defined in RFC 1982.
///
/// \note RFC 1982 defines everything based on the value SERIAL_BITS. Since
/// the serial number has a fixed length of 32 bits, the values we use are
/// hard-coded, and not computed based on variable bit lengths.

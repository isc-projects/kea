.SH "NAME"
b10-resolver \- Recursive DNS server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-resolver\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-resolver\fR [\fB\-u\ \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR] [\fB\-v\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
daemon provides the BIND 10 recursive DNS server\&. Normally it is started by the
\fBbind10\fR(8)
boss process\&.
.PP
This daemon communicates with other BIND 10 components over a
\fBb10-msgq\fR(8)
C\-Channel connection\&. If this connection is not established,
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
will exit\&.
.PP
It also receives its configurations from
\fBb10-cfgmgr\fR(8)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-u \fR\fB\fIusername\fR\fR
.RS 4
The user name of the
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
daemon\&. If specified, the daemon changes the process owner to the specified user\&. The
\fIusername\fR
must be either a valid numeric user ID or a valid user name\&. By default the daemon runs as the user who invokes it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Enabled verbose mode\&. This enables diagnostic messages to STDERR\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The configurable settings are:
.PP

\fIforward_addresses\fR
defines the list of addresses and ports that
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
should forward queries to\&. Defining this enables forwarding\&.
.PP

\fIlisten_on\fR
is a list of addresses and ports for
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
to listen on\&. The list items are the
\fIaddress\fR
string and
\fIport\fR
number\&. The defaults are address ::1 port 5300 and address 127\&.0\&.0\&.1 port 5300\&.
.PP

\fIretries\fR
is the number of times to retry (resend query) after a query timeout (\fItimeout_query\fR)\&. The default is 3\&.
.PP

\fIroot_addresses\fR
is a list of addresses and ports for
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
to use directly as root servers to start resolving\&. The list items are the
\fIaddress\fR
string and
\fIport\fR
number\&. If empty, a hardcoded address for F\-root (192\&.5\&.5\&.241) is used\&.
.PP

\fItimeout_client\fR
is the number of milliseconds to wait before timing out the incoming client query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 4000\&. After this timeout, a SERVFAIL is sent back to the client asking the question\&. (The lookup may continue after the timeout, but a later answer is not returned for the now\-past query\&.)
.PP

\fItimeout_lookup\fR
is the number of milliseconds before it stops trying the query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 30000\&.
.PP


\fItimeout_query\fR
is the number of milliseconds to wait before it retries a query\&. If set to \-1, this timeout is disabled\&. The default is 2000\&.
.PP
The configuration command is:
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
exits
\fBb10\-resolver\fR\&. (Note that the BIND 10 boss process will restart this service\&.)

.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-resolver\fR
daemon was first coded in September 2010\&. The initial implementation only provided forwarding\&. Iteration was introduced in January 2011\&.

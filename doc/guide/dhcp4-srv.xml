      <title>Starting and Stopping the DHCPv4 Server</title>

      <para>
        It is recommended that the Kea DHCPv4 server be started and stopped
        using <command>keactrl</command> (described in <xref linkend="keactrl"/>).
        However, it is also possible to run the server directly: it accepts
        the following command-line switches:

            <command>-d</command> - specifies whether the server
            logging should be switched to debug/verbose mode. In verbose mode,
            the logging severity and debuglevel specified in the configuration
            file are ignored and "debug" severity and the maximum debuglevel
            (99) are assumed. The flag is convenient, for temporarily
            switching the server into maximum verbosity, e.g. when
            debugging.</simpara>

            specifies UDP port on which the server will listen. This is only
            useful during testing, as a DHCPv4 server listening on
            ports other than the standard ones will not be able to
            handle regular DHCPv4 queries.</simpara>

        in the install directory or in the <filename>.libs</filename>
        subdirectory in the source tree. For example

      <para>
        On start-up, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces
        mentioned in the configuration file.
        Since the DHCPv4 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.
      </para>

      <para>
        During startup the server will attempt to create a PID file of the
        form: localstatedir]/[conf name].kea-dhcp6.pid where:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
            <simpara><command>localstatedir</command>: The value as passed into the
            build configure script. It defaults to "/usr/local/var".  (Note
            that this value may be overridden at run time by setting the environment
            variable KEA_PIDFILE_DIR.  This is intended primarily for testing purposes.)

            </listitem>
            <listitem>
            <simpara><command>conf name</command>: The configuration file name
            used to start the server, minus all preceding path and file extension.
            For example, given a pathname of "/usr/local/etc/kea/myconf.txt", the
            portion used would be "myconf".
            </simpara>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        If the file already exists and contains the PID of a live process,
        the server will issue a DHCP4_ALREADY_RUNNING log message and exit. It
        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea.  In such a
        case it would be necessary to manually delete the PID file.
      </para>

      <para>
        The server can be stopped using the <command>kill</command> command.
        When running in a console, the server can also be shut down by
        pressing ctrl-c. It detects the key combination and shuts
        down gracefully.

      <title>DHCPv4 Server Configuration</title>
<section>
  <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>
        This section explains how to configure the DHCPv4 server using the
        Kea configuration backend. (Kea configuration using any other
        backends is outside of scope of this document.) Before DHCPv4
        is started, its configuration file has to be created. The
        basic configuration is as follows:
<screen>
{
# DHCPv4 configuration starts in this line
"Dhcp4": {

# First we set up global values
    "valid-lifetime": 4000,
    "renew-timer": 1000,
    "rebind-timer": 2000,

# Next we setup the interfaces to be used by the server.
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ "eth0" ]
    },

# And we specify the type of lease database
    "lease-database": {
        "type": "memfile",
        "persist": true,
        "name": "/var/kea/dhcp4.leases"
    },

# Finally, we list the subnets from which we will be leasing addresses.
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                {
                     "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
# DHCPv4 configuration ends with the next line
}

} </screen>
</para>

<para>The following paragraphs provide a brief overview of the parameters in
the above example together with
their format. Subsequent sections of this chapter go into much greater detail
for these and other parameters.</para>

<para>The lines starting with a hash (#) are comments and are ignored by
the server; they do not impact its
operation in any way.</para>

<para>The configuration starts in the first line with the initial
opening curly bracket (or brace). Each configuration consists of
one or more objects. In this specific example, we have only one
object, called Dhcp4. This is a simplified configuration, as usually
there will be additional objects, like <command>Logging</command> or
<command>DhcpDns</command>, but we omit them now for clarity. The Dhcp4
configuration starts with the <command>"Dhcp4": {</command> line
and ends with the corresponding closing brace (in the above example,
the brace after the last comment).  Everything defined between those
lines is considered to be the Dhcp4 configuration.</para>

<para>In the general case, the order in which those parameters appear does not
matter. There are two caveats here though. The first one is to remember that
the configuration file must be well formed JSON. That means that the parameters
for any given scope must be separated by a comma and there must not be a comma
after the last parameter. When reordering a configuration file, keep in mind that
moving a parameter to or from the last position in a given scope may also require
moving the comma. The second caveat is that it is uncommon &mdash; although
legal JSON &mdash; to
repeat the same parameter multiple times. If that happens, the last occurrence of a
given parameter in a given scope is used while all previous instances are
ignored. This is unlikely to cause any confusion as there are no real life
reasons to keep multiple copies of the same parameter in your configuration
file.</para>

<para>Moving onto the DHCPv4 configuration elements, the first few elements
define some global parameters. <command>valid-lifetime</command>
defines for how long the addresses (leases) given out by the
server are valid. If nothing changes, a client that got an address is allowed to
use it for 4000 seconds. (Note that integer numbers are specified as is,
without any quotes around them.) <command>renew-timer</command> and
<command>rebind-timer</command> are values (also in seconds) that
define T1 and T2 timers that govern when the client will begin the renewal and
rebind procedures. Note that <command>renew-timer</command> and
<command>rebind-timer</command> are optional. If they are not specified the
client will select values for T1 and T2 timers according to the
<ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131">RFC 2131</ulink>.</para>

<para>The <command>interfaces-config</command> map specifies the server
configuration concerning the network interfaces, on which the server should
listen to the DHCP messages. The <command>interfaces</command> parameter
specifies a list of network interfaces on which the server should listen.
Lists are opened and closed with square brackets, with elements separated
by commas. Had we wanted to listen on two interfaces, the
<command>interfaces-config</command> would look like this:
<screen>
"interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "eth0", "eth1" ]
},
</screen>
</para>

<para>The next couple of lines define the lease database, the place where the server
stores its lease information. This particular example tells the server to use
<command>memfile</command>, which is the simplest (and fastest) database
backend. It uses an in-memory database and stores leases on disk in a CSV
file. This is a very simple configuration. Usually the lease database configuration
is more extensive and contains additional parameters.  Note that
<command>lease-database</command>
is an object and opens up a new scope, using an opening brace.
Its parameters (just one in this example - <command>type</command>)
follow. Had there been more than one, they would be separated by commas. This
scope is closed with a closing brace. As more parameters for the Dhcp4 definition
follow, a trailing comma is present.</para>

<para>Finally, we need to define a list of IPv4 subnets. This is the
most important DHCPv4 configuration structure as the server uses that
information to process clients' requests. It defines all subnets from
which the server is expected to receive DHCP requests. The subnets are
specified with the <command>subnet4</command> parameter.  It is a list,
so it starts and ends with square brackets.  Each subnet definition in
the list has several attributes associated with it, so it is a structure
and is opened and closed with braces. At a minimum, a subnet definition
has to have at least two parameters: <command>subnet</command> (that
defines the whole subnet) and <command>pools</command> (which is a list of
dynamically allocated pools that are governed by the DHCP server).</para>

<para>The example contains a single subnet. Had more than one been defined,
additional elements
in the <command>subnet4</command> parameter would be specified and
separated by commas. For example, to define three subnets, the following
syntax would be used:
<screen>
"subnet4": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool":  "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24"
    },
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.4.1 - 192.0.4.254" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.4.0/24"
    }
]
</screen>
Note that indentation is optional and is used for aesthetic purposes only.
In some cases in may be preferable to use more compact notation.
</para>

<para>After all the parameters have been specified, we have two contexts open:
global and Dhcp4, hence we need two closing curly brackets to close them.
In a real life configuration file there most likely would be additional
components defined such as Logging or DhcpDdns, so the closing brace would
be followed by a comma and another object definition.</para>
</section>

<section>
  <title>Lease Storage</title>
  <para>All leases issued by the server are stored in the lease database.
  Currently there are four database backends available:  memfile (which is the
  default backend), MySQL, PostgreSQL and Cassandra.</para>
<section>
  <title>Memfile - Basic Storage for Leases</title>

  <para>The server is able to store lease data in different repositories. Larger
  deployments may elect to store leases in a database. <xref
  linkend="database-configuration4"/> describes this option. In typical
  smaller deployments though, the server will store lease information in a CSV file rather
  than a database. As well as requiring less administration, an
  advantage of using a file for storage is that it
  eliminates a dependency on third-party database software.</para>

  <para>The configuration of the file backend (Memfile) is controlled through
  the Dhcp4/lease-database parameters. The <command>type</command> parameter
  is mandatory and it specifies which storage for leases the server should use.
  The value of <userinput>"memfile"</userinput> indicates that the file should
  be used as the storage. The following list gives additional, optional,
  parameters that can be used to configure the Memfile backend.

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <simpara><command>persist</command>: controls whether the new leases and
      updates to existing leases are written to the file. It is strongly
      recommended that the value of this parameter is set to
      <userinput>true</userinput> at all times, during the server's normal
      operation. Not writing leases to disk will mean that if a server is restarted
      (e.g. after a power failure), it will not know what addresses have been
      assigned.  As a result, it may hand out addresses to new clients that are
      already in use. The value of <userinput>false</userinput> is mostly useful
      for performance testing purposes. The default value of the
      <command>persist</command> parameter is <userinput>true</userinput>,
      which enables writing lease updates
      to the lease file.
      </simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara><command>name</command>: specifies an absolute location of the lease
      file in which new leases and lease updates will be recorded. The default value
      for this parameter is <userinput>"[kea-install-dir]/var/kea/kea-leases4.csv"
      </userinput>.</simpara>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <simpara><command>lfc-interval</command>: specifies the interval in seconds, at
      which the server will perform a lease file cleanup (LFC).  This
      removes redundant (historical) information from the lease file
      and effectively reduces the lease file size. The cleanup process is described
      in more detailed fashion further in this section. The default value of the
      <command>lfc-interval</command> is <userinput>0</userinput>, which disables
      the LFC.</simpara>
    </listitem>

  </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>An example configuration of the Memfile backend is presented below:

<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "lease-database": {
        <userinput>"type": "memfile"</userinput>,
        <userinput>"persist": true</userinput>,
        <userinput>"name": "/tmp/kea-leases4.csv",</userinput>
        <userinput>"lfc-interval": 1800</userinput>
    }
}
</screen>

    This configuration selects the <filename>/tmp/kea-leases4.csv</filename> as
    the storage for lease information and enables persistence (writing lease updates
    to this file). It also configures the backend perform the periodic cleanup
    of the lease files, executed every 30 minutes.
  </para>

  <para>It is important to know how the lease file contents are organized
  to understand why the periodic lease file cleanup is needed. Every time
  the server updates a lease or creates a new lease for the client, the new
  lease information must be recorded in the lease file. For performance reasons,
  the server does not update the existing client's lease in the file, as it would
  potentially require rewriting the entire file. Instead, it simply appends the new lease
  information to the end of the file: the previous lease entries for the
  client are not removed. When the server loads leases from the lease file, e.g.
  at the server startup, it assumes that the latest lease entry for the client
  is the valid one. The previous entries are discarded. This means that the
  server can re-construct the accurate information about the leases even though
  there may be many lease entries for each client. However, storing many entries
  for each client results in bloated lease file and impairs the performance of
  the server's startup and reconfiguration as it needs to process a larger number
  of lease entries.
  </para>

  <para>Lease file cleanup (LFC) removes all previous entries for each client and
  leaves only the latest ones. The interval at which the cleanup is performed
  is configurable, and it should be selected according to the frequency of lease
  renewals initiated by the clients. The more frequent the renewals, the smaller
  the value of <command>lfc-interval</command> should be. Note however, that the
  LFC takes time and thus it is possible (although unlikely) that new cleanup
  is started while the previous cleanup instance is still running, if the
  <command>lfc-interval</command> is too short. The server would recover from
  this by skipping the new cleanup when it detects that the previous cleanup
  is still in progress. But it implies that the actual cleanups will be
  triggered more rarely than configured. Moreover, triggering a new cleanup
  adds an overhead to the server which will not be able to respond to new
  requests for a short period of time when the new cleanup process is spawned.
  Therefore, it is recommended that the <command>lfc-interval</command> value
  is selected in a way that would allow for the LFC to complete the cleanup before a
  new cleanup is triggered.
  </para>

  <para>Lease file cleanup is performed by a separate process (in background) to avoid
  a performance impact on the server process. In order to avoid the conflicts
  between two processes both using the same lease files, the LFC process
  operates on the copy of the original lease file, rather than on the lease
  file used by the server to record lease updates. There are also other files
  being created as a side effect of the lease file cleanup. The detailed
  description of the LFC is located on the Kea wiki:
  <ulink url="http://kea.isc.org/wiki/LFCDesign"/>.
  </para>

<section id="database-configuration4">
  <title>Lease Database Configuration</title>

  <note>
    <para>Lease database access information must be configured for the DHCPv4 server,
    even if it has already been configured for the DHCPv6 server. The servers
    store their information independently, so each server can use a separate
    database or both servers can use the same database.</para>
  </note>

  <para>Lease database configuration is controlled through the Dhcp4/lease-database
  parameters. The type of the database must be set to "memfile", "mysql", "postgresql" or
  "cql", e.g.
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"type": "mysql"</userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  Next, the name of the database to hold the leases must be set: this is the
  name used when the database was created
  (see <xref linkend="mysql-database-create"/>,
  <xref linkend="pgsql-database-create"/> or
  <xref linkend="cql-database-create"/>).
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"name": "<replaceable>database-name</replaceable>" </userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  If the database is located on a different system to the DHCPv4 server, the
  database host name must also be specified. (It should be noted that this
  configuration may have a severe impact on server performance.):
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"host": <replaceable>remote-host-name</replaceable></userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  The usual state of affairs will be to have the database on the same machine as
  the DHCPv4 server.  In this case, set the value to the empty string:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"host" : ""</userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  Should the database be located on a different system, you may need to specify a longer interval
  for the connection timeout:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"connect-timeout" : <replaceable>timeout-in-seconds</replaceable></userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
The default value of five seconds should be more than adequate for local connections.
If a timeout is given though, it should be an integer greater than zero.
  </para>
  <para>Finally, the credentials of the account under which the server will
  access the database should be set:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "lease-database": { <userinput>"user": "<replaceable>user-name</replaceable>"</userinput>,
                               <userinput>"password": "<replaceable>password</replaceable>"</userinput>,
                              ... },
           ... }
</screen>
  If there is no password to the account, set the password to the empty string
  "". (This is also the default.)</para>

</section>

<section id="hosts-storage4">
  <title>Hosts Storage</title>
    <para>Kea is also able to store information about host reservations in the
    database. The hosts database configuration uses the same syntax as the lease
    database. In fact, a Kea server opens independent connections for each
    purpose, be it lease or hosts information. This arrangement gives the most
    flexibility. Kea can be used to keep leases and host reservations
    separately, but can also point to the same database. Currently the
    supported hosts database types are MySQL and PostgreSQL. The Cassandra
    backend does not support host reservations yet.</para>

    <para>Please note that usage of hosts storage is optional. A user can define
    all host reservations in the configuration file. That is the recommended way
    if the number of reservations is small. However, when the number of
    reservations grows it's more convenient to use host storage. Please note
    that both storage methods (configuration file and one of the supported databases)
    can be used together. If hosts are defined in both places, the definitions
    from the configuration file are checked first and external storage is checked
    later, if necessary.</para>

<section id="hosts-database-configuration4">
  <title>DHCPv4 Hosts Database Configuration</title>

  <para>Hosts database configuration is controlled through the Dhcp4/hosts-database
  parameters. If enabled, the type of the database must be set to "mysql" or
  "postgresql". Other hosts backends may be added in later versions of Kea.
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "hosts-database": { <userinput>"type": "mysql"</userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  Next, the name of the database to hold the reservations must be set: this is the
  name used when the lease database was created (see <xref linkend="supported-databases"/>
  for instructions how to setup the desired database type).
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "hosts-database": { <userinput>"name": "<replaceable>database-name</replaceable>" </userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
  If the database is located on a different system than the DHCPv4 server, the

<para>
In some deployments the database user whose name is specified in the database backend
configuration may not have write privileges to the database. This is often
required by the policy within a given network to secure the data from being
unintentionally modified. In many cases administrators have inventory databases
deployed, which contain substantially more information about the hosts than
static reservations assigned to them. The inventory database can be used to create
a view of a Kea hosts database and such view is often read only.
</para>
<para>
Kea host database backends operate with an implicit configuration to both
read from and write to the database. If the database user does not have
write access to the host database, the backend will fail to start and the
server will refuse to start (or reconfigure). However, if access to a read
only host database is required for retrieving reservations for clients
and/or assign specific addresses and options, it is possible to explicitly
configure Kea to start in "read-only" mode. This is controlled by the
<command>readonly</command> boolean parameter as follows:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": { "hosts-database": { <userinput>"readonly": true</userinput>, ... }, ... }
</screen>
Setting this parameter to <userinput>false</userinput> would configure the
database backend to operate in "read-write" mode, which is also a default
configuration if the parameter is not specified.

for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.</para></note>

<section id="dhcp4-interface-configuration">
  <title>Interface Configuration</title>
  <para>The DHCPv4 server has to be configured to listen on specific network
  interfaces.  The simplest network interface configuration tells the server to
  listen on all available interfaces:
  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"*"</userinput> ]
    }
    ...
},
  </screen>
  The asterisk plays the role of a wildcard and means "listen on all interfaces".
  However, it is usually a good idea to explicitly specify interface names:
  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"eth1", "eth3"</userinput> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </screen>
  </para>
  <para>It is possible to use wildcard interface name (asterisk) concurrently
  with explicit interface names:
  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"eth1", "eth3", "*"</userinput> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </screen>
It is anticipated that this form of usage will only be used when it is desired to
temporarily override a list of interface names and listen on all interfaces.
  </para>
  <para>Some deployments of DHCP servers require that the servers listen
  on the interfaces with multiple IPv4 addresses configured. In these situations,
  the address to use can be selected by appending an IPv4 address to the interface
  name in the following manner:
  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth3/192.0.2.3"</userinput> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </screen>
  </para>

  <para>Should the server be required to listen on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned
  to the same interface, multiple addresses can be specified for an interface
  as in the example below:
  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"eth1/10.0.0.1", "eth1/10.0.0.2"</userinput> ]
    },
    ...
}
  </screen>
  </para>

  <para>Alternatively, if the server should listen on all addresses for the particular
  interface, an interface name without any address should be specified.</para>

  <para>Kea supports responding to directly connected clients which don't have
  an address configured. This requires that the server
  injects the hardware address of the destination into the data link layer
  of the packet being sent to the client. The DHCPv4 server utilizes the
  raw sockets to achieve this, and builds the entire IP/UDP stack for the
  outgoing packets. The down side of raw socket use, however, is that incoming
  and outgoing packets bypass the firewalls (e.g. iptables). It is also
  troublesome to handle traffic on multiple IPv4 addresses assigned to the
  same interface, as raw sockets are bound to the interface and advanced
  packet filtering techniques (e.g. using the BPF) have to be used to
  receive unicast traffic on the desired addresses assigned to the interface,
  rather than capturing whole traffic reaching the interface to which the raw
  socket is bound. Therefore, in the deployments where the server doesn't
  have to provision the directly connected clients and only receives the
  unicast packets from the relay agents, the
  DHCP server should be configured to utilize IP/UDP datagram sockets instead of raw sockets.
  The following configuration demonstrates how this can be achieved:

  <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "interfaces-config": {
        "interfaces": [ <userinput>"eth1", "eth3"</userinput> ],
        "dhcp-socket-type": "udp"
    },
    ...
}
  </screen>
  The <command>dhcp-socket-type</command> specifies that the IP/UDP sockets will
  be opened on all interfaces on which the server listens, i.e. "eth1" and
  "eth3" in our case. If the <command>dhcp-socket-type</command> is set to
  <userinput>raw</userinput>, it configures the server to use raw sockets
  instead. If the <command>dhcp-socket-type</command> value is not specified, the
  default value <userinput>raw</userinput> is used.
  </para>

  <para>Using UDP sockets automatically disables the reception of broadcast
  packets from directly connected clients. This effectively means that the
  UDP sockets can be used for relayed traffic only. When using the raw sockets,
  both the traffic from the directly connected clients and the relayed traffic
  will be handled. Caution should be taken when configuring the server to open
  multiple raw sockets on the interface with several IPv4 addresses assigned.
  If the directly connected client sends the message to the broadcast address
  all sockets on this link will receive this message and multiple responses
  will be sent to the client. Hence, the configuration with multiple IPv4
  addresses assigned to the interface should not be used when the directly
  connected clients are operating on that link. To use a single address on
  such interface, the "interface-name/address" notation should be used.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>Specifying the value <userinput>raw</userinput> as the socket type,
    doesn't guarantee that the raw sockets will be used! The use of raw sockets
    to handle the traffic from the directly connected clients is currently
    supported on Linux and BSD systems only. If the raw sockets are not
    supported on the particular OS, the server will issue a warning and
    fall back to use IP/UDP sockets.</para>

<section id="dhcpinform-unicast-issues">
  <title>Issues with Unicast Responses to DHCPINFORM</title>
  <para>The use of UDP sockets has certain benefits in deployments
  where the server receives only relayed traffic; these benefits are
  mentioned in <xref linkend="dhcp4-interface-configuration"/>. From
  the administrator's perspective it is often desirable to
  configure the system's firewall to filter out the unwanted traffic, and
  the use of UDP sockets facilitates this. However, the administrator must
  also be aware of the implications related to filtering certain types
  of traffic as it may impair the DHCP server's operation.
  </para>

  <para>In this section we are focusing on the case when the server
  receives the DHCPINFORM message from the client via a relay. According
  to <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131">RFC 2131</ulink>,
  the server should unicast the DHCPACK response to the address carried in
  the "ciaddr" field. When the UDP socket is in use, the DHCP server
  relies on the low level functions of an operating system to build the
  data link, IP and UDP layers of the outgoing message. Typically, the
  OS will first use ARP to obtain the client's link layer address to be
  inserted into the frame's header, if the address is not cached from
  a previous transaction that the client had with the server.
  When the ARP exchange is successful, the DHCP message can be unicast
  to the client, using the  obtained address.
  </para>

  <para>Some system administrators block ARP messages in their network,
  which causes issues for the server when it responds to the
  DHCPINFORM messages, because the server is unable to send the
  DHCPACK if the preceding ARP communication fails. Since the OS is
  entirely responsible for the ARP communication and then sending
  the DHCP packet over the wire, the DHCP server has no means to
  determine that the ARP exchange failed and the DHCP response message
  was dropped. Thus, the server does not log any error messages when
  the outgoing DHCP response is dropped. At the same time, all hooks
  pertaining to the packet sending operation will be called, even
  though the message never reaches its destination.
  </para>

  <para>Note that the issue described in this section is not observed
  when the raw sockets are in use, because, in this case, the DHCP server
  builds all the layers of the outgoing message on its own and does not
  use ARP. Instead, it inserts the value carried in the 'chaddr' field
  of the DHCPINFORM message into the link layer.
  </para>

  <para>Server administrators willing to support DHCPINFORM
  messages via relays should not block ARP traffic in their
  networks or should use raw sockets instead of UDP sockets.
  </para>

<section id="ipv4-subnet-id">
  <title>IPv4 Subnet Identifier</title>
  <para>
    The subnet identifier is a unique number associated with a particular subnet.
    In principle, it is used to associate clients' leases with their respective subnets.
    When a subnet identifier is not specified for a subnet being configured, it will
    be automatically assigned by the configuration mechanism. The identifiers
    are assigned from 1 and are monotonically increased for each subsequent
    subnet: 1, 2, 3 ....
  </para>
  <para>
    If there are multiple subnets configured with auto-generated identifiers and
    one of them is removed, the subnet identifiers may be renumbered. For example:
    if there are four subnets and the third is removed the last subnet will be assigned
    the identifier that the third subnet had before removal. As a result, the leases
    stored in the lease database for subnet 3 are now associated with
    subnet 4, something that may have unexpected consequences. It is planned
    to implement a mechanism to preserve auto-generated subnet ids in a
    future version of Kea.  However, the only remedy for this issue
    at present is to
    manually specify a unique identifier for each subnet.
  </para>
      <para>
        The following configuration will assign the specified subnet
        identifier to the newly configured subnet:

        <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            <userinput>"id": 1024</userinput>,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</screen>
    This identifier will not change for this subnet unless the "id" parameter is
    removed or set to 0. The value of 0 forces auto-generation of the subnet
    identifier.
  </para>
    <!-- @todo: describe whether database needs to be updated after changing
      id -->
</section>

<section id="dhcp4-address-config">
  <title>Configuration of IPv4 Address Pools</title>
  <para>
    The main role of a DHCPv4 server is address assignment. For this, the server has to
    be configured with at least one subnet and one pool of dynamic addresses for it to manage.
    For example, assume that the server is connected to a network
    segment that uses the 192.0.2.0/24 prefix. The Administrator of that network
    has decided that addresses from range 192.0.2.10 to 192.0.2.20 are going to
    be managed by the Dhcp4 server. Such a configuration can be achieved in the
    following way:
    <screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    <userinput>"subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10 - 192.0.2.20" }
            ],
            ...
        }
    ]</userinput>
}</screen>

    Note that <command>subnet</command> is defined as a simple string, but
    the <command>pools</command> parameter is actually a list of pools: for
    this reason, the pool definition is enclosed in square brackets, even
    though only one range of addresses is specified.</para>

    <para>Each <command>pool</command> is a structure that contains the
    parameters that describe a single pool. Currently there is only one
    parameter, <command>pool</command>, which gives the range of addresses
    in the pool. Additional parameters will be added in future releases of
    Kea.</para>

    <para>It is possible to define more than one pool in a subnet: continuing
    the previous example, further assume that 192.0.2.64/26 should be also be
    managed by the server. It could be written as 192.0.2.64 to
    192.0.2.127. Alternatively, it can be expressed more simply as
    192.0.2.64/26. Both formats are supported by Dhcp4 and can be mixed in the
    pool list.  For example, one could define the following pools:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            <userinput>"pools": [
                { "pool": "192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20" },
                { "pool": "192.0.2.64/26" }
            ]</userinput>,
            ...
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</screen>
    White space in pool definitions is ignored, so spaces before and after the hyphen are optional.
    They can be used to improve readability.
  </para>
  <para>
    The number of pools is not limited, but for performance reasons it is recommended to
    use as few as possible.
  </para>
  <para>
    The server may be configured to serve more than one subnet:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.3.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.3.100 - 192.0.3.200" } ],
            ...
        },
        {
            "subnet": "192.0.4.0/24",
            "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.4.1 - 192.0.4.254" } ],
            ...
        }
    ]
}
</screen>
  </para>
  <para>
    When configuring a DHCPv4 server using prefix/length notation, please pay
    attention to the boundary values. When specifying that the server can use
    a given pool, it will also be able to allocate the first (typically network
    address) and the last (typically broadcast address) address from that pool.
    In the aforementioned example of pool 192.0.3.0/24, both 192.0.3.0 and
    192.0.3.255 addresses may be assigned as well. This may be invalid in some
    network configurations. If you want to avoid this, please use the "min-max" notation.

      <title>Standard DHCPv4 Options</title>
      <para>
        One of the major features of the DHCPv4 server is to provide configuration
        options to clients. Most of the options are sent by the server only if the
        client explicitly requests them using the Parameter Request List option.
        Those that do not require inclusion in the Parameter Request List
        option are commonly used options, e.g. "Domain Server", and options which
        require special behavior, e.g. "Client FQDN" is returned to the client
        if the client has included this option in its message to the server.
      </para>

      <para>
        <xref linkend="dhcp4-std-options-list"/> comprises the list of the
        standard DHCPv4 options whose values can be configured using the
        configuration structures described in this section. This table excludes
        the options which require special processing and thus cannot be configured
        with some fixed values. The last column of the table indicates which
        options can be sent by the server even when they are not requested in

        The following example shows how to configure the addresses of DNS

      The <command>code</command> parameter specifies the option code, which must match one of the
      values from that list. The next line specifies the option space, which must always
      be set to "dhcp4" as these are standard DHCPv4 options. For
      other option spaces, including custom option spaces, see <xref

      values separated by commas if more than one value is
      allowed.

      Options can also be configured as hexadecimal values. If

        It is possible to specify or override options on a per-subnet basis.  If

        can then override specific values for a small number of subnets.
        On the other hand, if you use different values in each subnet,
        it does not make sense to specify global option values

        Some options are designated as arrays, which means that more than one

        The <xref linkend="dhcp4-custom-options"/> describes the configuration

        allowed to create custom definitions for standard options, even if the
        definition being created matches the actual option format defined in the
        RFCs. There is an exception from this rule for standard options for which
        Kea currently does not provide a definition. In order to use such options,
        a server administrator must create a definition as described in
        <xref linkend="dhcp4-custom-options"/> in the 'dhcp4' option space. This
        definition should match the option format described in the relevant
        RFC but the configuration mechanism will allow any option format as it
        presently has no means to validate it.

      <title>Custom DHCPv4 options</title>
      <para>Kea supports custom (non-standard) DHCPv4 options. Assume
      that we want to define a new DHCPv4 option called "foo" which
      will have a code 222 and will convey a single unsigned 32 bit
      integer value. We can define such an option by using the
      following entry in the configuration file:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "foo",
            "code": 222,
            "type": "uint32",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "encapsulate": ""</userinput>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</screen>
      The <command>false</command> value of the <command>array</command>
      parameter determines that the option does NOT comprise an array of
      "uint32" values but is, instead, a single value.  Two other parameters have been
      left blank: <command>record-types</command> and
      <command>encapsulate</command>.  The former specifies the comma separated
      list of option data fields if the option comprises a record of data
      fields. This should be non-empty if the <command>type</command> is set to
      "record". Otherwise it must be left blank. The latter parameter specifies
      the name of the option space being encapsulated by the particular
      option. If the particular option does not encapsulate any option space it
      should be left blank.  Note that the above set of comments define the
      format of the new option and do not set its values.
      </para>

      <para>The <command>name</command>, <command>code</command> and
      <command>type</command> parameters are required, all others are
      optional. The <command>array</command> default value is
      <command>false</command>. The <command>record-types</command>
      and <command>encapsulate</command> default values are blank
      (i.e. ""). The default <command>space</command> is "dhcp4".
      </para>

      <para>Once the new option format is defined, its value is set
      in the same way as for a standard option. For example the following
      commands set a global value that applies to all subnets.
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "foo",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "csv-format": true,
            "data": "12345"</userinput>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</screen>
      </para>

      <para>New options can take more complex forms than simple use of
      primitives (uint8, string, ipv4-address etc): it is possible to
      define an option comprising a number of existing primitives.
      Assume we want to define a new option that will consist of
      an IPv4 address, followed by an unsigned 16 bit integer, followed by
      a boolean value, followed by a text string. Such an option could
      be defined in the following way:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "bar",
            "code": 223,
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "type": "record",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "ipv4-address, uint16, boolean, string",
            "encapsulate": ""</userinput>
        }, ...
    ],
    ...
}
</screen>
      The <command>type</command> is set to "record" to indicate that the option contains
      multiple values of different types.  These types are given as a comma-separated
      list in the <command>record-types</command> field and should be ones from those listed in <xref linkend="dhcp-types"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
      The values of the option are set as follows:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "bar",
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "code": 223,
            "csv-format": true,
            "data": "192.0.2.100, 123, true, Hello World"</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
      <command>csv-format</command> is set to <command>true</command> to indicate
      that the <command>data</command> field comprises a command-separated list
      of values.  The values in the <command>data</command> must correspond to
      the types set in the <command>record-types</command> field of the option
      definition.
     </para>
     <note>
       <para>In the general case, boolean values are specified as <command>true</command> or
       <command>false</command>, without quotes. Some specific boolean parameters may
       accept also <command>"true"</command>, <command>"false"</command>,
       <command>0</command>, <command>1</command>, <command>"0"</command> and
       <command>"1"</command>. Future versions of Kea will accept all those values
       for all boolean parameters.</para>

    <section id="dhcp4-vendor-opts">
      <title>DHCPv4 Vendor Specific Options</title>
      <para>
      Currently there are two option spaces defined for the DHCPv4 daemon:
      "dhcp4" (for the top level DHCPv4 options) and
      "vendor-encapsulated-options-space", which is empty by default but
      in which options can be defined. Such options will be carried in the
      Vendor Specific Information option (code 43). The following examples
      show how to define an option "foo" in that space that has a code 1,
      and comprises an
      IPv4 address, an unsigned 16 bit integer and a string. The "foo"
      option is conveyed in a Vendor Specific Information option.
      </para>
      <para>
      The first step is to define the format of the option:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "foo",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "type": "record",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "ipv4-address, uint16, string",
            "encapsulate": ""</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
     (Note that the option space is set to "vendor-encapsulated-options-space".)
     Once the option format is defined, the next step is to define actual values
     for that option:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "foo",
            "space": "vendor-encapsulated-options-space",
            "code": 1,
            "csv-format": true,
            "data": "192.0.2.3, 123, Hello World"</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
    We also include the Vendor Specific Information option, the option
    that conveys our sub-option "foo". This is required, else the option
    will not be included in messages sent to the client.
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "vendor-encapsulated-options"</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
    Alternatively, the option can be specified using its code.

<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"code": 43</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="dhcp4-option-spaces">

      <title>Nested DHCPv4 Options (Custom Option Spaces)</title>
      <para>It is sometimes useful to define a completely new option
      space. This is the case when user creates new option in the
      standard option space ("dhcp4") and wants this option
      to convey sub-options. Since they are in a separate space,
      sub-option codes will have a separate numbering scheme and may
      overlap with the codes of standard options.
      </para>
      <para>Note that creation of a new option space when defining
      sub-options for a standard option is not required, because it is
      created by default if the standard option is meant to convey any
      sub-options (see <xref linkend="dhcp4-vendor-opts"/>).
      </para>
      <para>
      Assume that we want to have a DHCPv4 option called "container" with
      code 222 that conveys two sub-options with codes 1 and 2.
      First we need to define the new sub-options:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "ipv4-address",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""
        },
        {
            "name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "type": "string",
            "record-types": "",
            "array": false,
            "encapsulate": ""</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
    Note that we have defined the options to belong to a new option space
    (in this case, "isc").
    </para>
    <para>
    The next step is to define a regular DHCPv4 option with our desired
    code and specify that it should include options from the new option space:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-def": [
        ...,
        {
            <userinput>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4",
            "type": "empty",
            "array": false,
            "record-types": "",
            "encapsulate": "isc"</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}</screen>
    The name of the option space in which the sub-options are defined
    is set in the <command>encapsulate</command> field. The <command>type</command> field is set to "empty"
    to indicate that this option does not carry any data other than
    sub-options.
    </para>
    <para>
    Finally, we can set values for the new options:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "option-data": [
        {
            <userinput>"name": "subopt1",
            "code": 1,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "192.0.2.3"</userinput>
        },
        }
            <userinput>"name": "subopt2",
            "code": 2,
            "space": "isc",
            "data": "Hello world"</userinput>
        },
        {
            <userinput>"name": "container",
            "code": 222,
            "space": "dhcp4"</userinput>
        }
    ],
    ...
}
</screen>
    </para>
    <para>Note that it is possible to create an option which carries some data
    in addition to the sub-options defined in the encapsulated option space.  For example,
    if the "container" option from the previous example was required to carry an uint16
    value as well as the sub-options, the <command>type</command> value would have to be set to "uint16" in
    the option definition. (Such an option would then have the following
    data structure: DHCP header, uint16 value, sub-options.) The value specified
    with the <command>data</command> parameter &mdash; which should be a valid integer enclosed in quotes,
    e.g. "123" &mdash; would then be assigned to the uint16 field in the "container" option.
    </para>

      <title>Unspecified Parameters for DHCPv4 Option Configuration</title>
      <para>In many cases it is not required to specify all parameters for
      an option configuration and the default values may be used. However, it is
      important to understand the implications of not specifying some of them
      as it may result in configuration errors. The list below explains
      the behavior of the server when a particular parameter is not explicitly
      specified:

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <simpara><command>name</command> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. If this parameter is unspecified, the
          option code must be specified.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><command>code</command> - the server requires an option name or
          option code to identify an option. This parameter may be left unspecified if
          the <command>name</command> parameter is specified. However, this also
          requires that the particular option has its definition (it is either a
          standard option or an administrator created a definition for the option
          using an 'option-def' structure), as the option definition associates an
          option with a particular name. It is possible to configure an option
          for which there is no definition (unspecified option format).
          Configuration of such options requires the use of option code.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><command>space</command> - if the option space is unspecified it
          will default to 'dhcp4' which is an option space holding DHCPv4 standard
          options.
          </simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><command>data</command> - if the option data is unspecified it
          defaults to an empty value. The empty value is mostly used for the
          options which have no payload (boolean options), but it is legal to specify
          empty values for some options which carry variable length data and which
          the specification allows for the length of 0. For such options, the data parameter
          may be omitted in the configuration.</simpara>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <simpara><command>csv-format</command> - if this value is not specified
          and the definition for the particular option exists, the server will assume
          that the option data is specified as a list of comma separated values to be
          assigned to individual fields of the DHCP option. If the definition
          does not exist for this option, the server will assume that the data
          parameter contains the option payload in the binary format (represented
          as a string of hexadecimal digits). Note that not specifying this
          parameter doesn't imply that it defaults to a fixed value, but
          the configuration data interpretation also depends on the presence
          of the option definition. An administrator must be aware if the
          definition for the particular option exists when this parameter
          is not specified. It is generally recommended to not specify this
          parameter only for the options for which the definition exists, e.g.
          standard options. Setting <command>csv-format</command> to an explicit
          value will cause the server to strictly check the format of the option
          data specified.

      <title>Stateless Configuration of DHCPv4 Clients</title>
      <para>The DHCPv4 server supports the stateless client configuration whereby the
      client has an IP address configured (e.g. using manual configuration) and only
      contacts the server to obtain other configuration parameters, e.g. addresses of DNS servers.
      In order to obtain the stateless configuration parameters the client sends the
      DHCPINFORM message to the server with the "ciaddr" set to the address that the
      client is currently using. The server unicasts the DHCPACK message to the
      client that includes the stateless configuration ("yiaddr" not set).
      </para>

      <para>The server will respond to the DHCPINFORM when the client is associated
      with a subnet defined in the server's configuration. An example
      subnet configuration will look like this:

      <title>Client Classification in DHCPv4</title>
      <para>
      The DHCPv4 server includes support for client classification.  For a deeper
      discussion of the classification process see <xref linkend="classify"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
      In certain cases it is useful to differentiate between different types of
      clients and treat them accordingly. It is envisaged that client
      classification will be used for changing the behavior of almost any part of
      the DHCP message processing, including the assignment of leases from different
      pools, the assignment of different options (or different values of the same
      options) etc. In the current release of the software however, there are
      only three mechanisms that take advantage of client classification:
      subnet selection, assignment of different options, and, for cable modems, there
      are specific options for use with the TFTP server address and the boot file field.
      </para>

      <para>
      Kea can be instructed to limit access to given subnets based on class information.
      This is particularly useful for cases where two types of devices share the
      same link and are expected to be served from two different subnets. The
      primary use case for such a scenario is cable networks. Here, there are two
      classes of devices: the cable modem itself, which should be handed a lease
      from subnet A and all other devices behind the modem that should get a lease
      from subnet B. That segregation is essential to prevent overly curious
      users from playing with their cable modems. For details on how to set up
      class restrictions on subnets, see <xref linkend="classification-subnets"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
      The process of doing classification is conducted in three steps. The first step
      is to assess an incoming packet and assign it to zero or more classes.  The
      second step is to choose a subnet, possibly based on the class information.
      The third step is to assign options, again possibly based on the class
      information.
      </para>

      <para>
      There are two methods of doing classification. The first is automatic and relies
      on examining the values in the vendor class options. Information from these
      options is extracted and a class name is constructed from it and added to
      the class list for the packet. The second allows you to specify an expression
      that is evaluated for each packet. If the result is true the packet is
      a member of the class.
      </para>

      <note><para>
        Care should be taken with client classification as it is easy for
        clients that do not meet class criteria to be denied any service altogether.
      </para></note>

      <section>
        <title>Setting Fixed Fields in Classification</title>
        <para>
          It is possible to specify that clients belonging to a particular class
          should receive packets with specific values in certain fixed fields.
          In particular, three fixed fields are supported:
          <command>next-server</command> (that conveys an IPv4 address, which is
          set in the siaddr field), <command>server-hostname</command> (that
          conveys a server hostname, can be up to 64 bytes long and will be sent
          in the sname field) and <command>boot-file-name</command> (that
          conveys the configuration file, can be up to 128 bytes long and will
          be sent using file field).
        </para>
        <para>
          Obviously, there are many ways to assign clients to specific classes,
          but for the PXE clients the client architecture type option (code 93)
          seems to be particularly suited to
          make the distinction. The following example checks if the client
          identifies itself as PXE device with architecture EFI x86-64, and
          sets several fields if it does. See
          <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4578#section-2.1">Section 2.1 of RFC 4578</ulink>)
          or the documentation of your client for specific values.

            If there are multiple classes defined and an incoming packet is matched

        <title>Using Vendor Class Information in Classification</title>
        <para>
        The server checks whether an incoming packet includes the vendor class identifier
        option (60). If it does, the content of that option is prepended with
        &quot;VENDOR_CLASS_&quot;, it is interpreted as a class. For example,
        modern cable modems will send this option with value &quot;docsis3.0&quot;
        and as a result the packet will belong to class &quot;VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0&quot;.
        </para>

        <note>
        <para>
          Kea 1.0 and earlier versions performed special actions for
          clients that were in VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0. This is no longer the
          case in Kea 1.1 and later. In these versions the old behavior
          can be achieved by defining VENDOR_CLASS_docsis3.0 and setting
          its next-server and boot-file-name values appropriately.

        <para>
        This example shows a configuration using an automatically generated

        decided that addresses from range 192.0.2.10 to 192.0.2.20 are
        going to be managed by the Dhcp4 server and only clients belonging to the
        docsis3.0 client class are allowed to use that pool.

      <para>
      In order for NCRs to reach the D2 server, kea-dhcp4 must be able
      to communicate with it.  kea-dhcp4 uses the following configuration
      parameters to control this communication:
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>
      <command>enable-updates</command> - determines whether or not kea-dhcp4 will

      <listitem><simpara>

      this value, DDNS updating will be turned off until the queue backlog has
      been sufficiently reduced.  The intention is to allow the kea-dhcp4 server to
      continue lease operations without running the risk that its memory usage
      grows without limit.  The default value is 1024.

      By default, kea-dhcp-ddns is assumed to be running on the same machine as kea-dhcp4, and
      all of the default values mentioned above should be sufficient.
      If, however, D2 has been configured to listen on a different address or
      port, these values must be altered accordingly. For example, if D2 has been
      configured to listen on 192.168.1.10 port 900, the following configuration
      would be required:

      <title>When Does the kea-dhcp4 Server Generate DDNS Requests?</title>
      <para>kea-dhcp4 follows the behavior prescribed for DHCP servers in
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702">RFC 4702</ulink>.
      It is important to keep in mind that kea-dhcp4 provides the initial decision
      making of when and what to update and forwards that information to D2 in
      the form of NCRs. Carrying out the actual DNS updates and dealing with
      such things as conflict resolution are within the purview of D2 itself (<xref linkend="dhcp-ddns-server"/>).
      This section describes when kea-dhcp4 will generate NCRs and the
      configuration parameters that can be used to influence this decision.
      It assumes that the <command>enable-updates</command> parameter is true.
      </para>
      <para>
      In general, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests when:
      <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>
      A new lease is granted in response to a DHCP REQUEST
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
      An existing lease is renewed but the FQDN associated with it has
      changed.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
      An existing lease is released in response to a DHCP RELEASE
      </para></listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      In the second case, lease renewal, two  DDNS requests will be issued: one
      request to remove entries for the previous FQDN and a second request to
      add entries for the new FQDN.  In the last case, a lease release, a
      single DDNS request to remove its entries will be made.
      </para>
      <para>
      The decision making involved when granting a new lease (the first case) is more
      involved.  When a new lease is granted, kea-dhcp4 will generate a DDNS
      update request if the DHCP REQUEST contains either the FQDN option
      (code 81) or the Host Name option (code 12). If both are present,
      the server will use the FQDN option. By default kea-dhcp4
      will respect the FQDN N and S flags specified by the client as shown
      in the following table:

      <para>
      The first row in the table above represents "client delegation". Here
      the DHCP client states that it intends to do the forward DNS updates and
      the server should do the reverse updates.  By default, kea-dhcp4 will honor
      the client's wishes and generate a DDNS request to the D2 server to update only
      reverse DNS data.  The parameter <command>override-client-update</command> can be used
      to instruct the server to override client delegation requests.  When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will disregard requests for client
      delegation and generate a DDNS request to update both forward and
      reverse DNS data.  In this case, the N-S-O flags in the server's
      response to the client will be 0-1-1 respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
      (Note that the flag combination N=1, S=1 is prohibited according to
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4702">RFC 4702</ulink>. If such a
      combination is received from the client, the packet will be dropped by kea-dhcp4.)
      </para>
      <para>
      To override client delegation, set the following values in the configuration file:
      </para>
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <userinput>"override-client-update": true</userinput>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</screen>
      <para>
      The third row in the table above describes the case in which the client
      requests that no DNS updates be done. The parameter, <command>override-no-update</command>,
      can be used to instruct the server to disregard the client's wishes. When
      this parameter is true, kea-dhcp4 will generate DDNS update requests to kea-dhcp-ddns
      even if the client requests that no updates be done.  The N-S-O flags in the
      server's response to the client will be 0-1-1.
      </para>
      <para>
      To override client delegation, the following values should be set in your configuration:

}
</screen>
      <para>
      kea-dhcp4 will always generate DDNS update requests if the client request
      only contains the Host Name option. In addition it will include an FQDN
      option in the response to the client with the FQDN N-S-O flags set to
      0-1-0 respectively. The domain name portion of the FQDN option will be
      the name submitted to D2 in the DDNS update request.

      <para>Each NameChangeRequest must of course include the fully qualified domain

      <para>
       The default rules for constructing the FQDN that will be used for DNS
       entries are:
      <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        If the DHCPREQUEST contains the client FQDN option, the candidate name
        is taken from there, otherwise it is taken from the Host Name option.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        If the candidate name is a partial (i.e. unqualified) name then add a
        configurable suffix to the name and use the result as the FQDN.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
        If the candidate name provided is empty, generate a FQDN using a
        configurable prefix and suffix.

      <listitem><para>
        If the client provided neither option, then no DNS action will be taken.
      </para></listitem>
      </orderedlist>
        These rules can amended by setting the
        <command>replace-client-name</command> parameter which provides the
        following modes of behavior:
      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>
        <command>never</command> - Use the name the client sent.  If the client
        sent no name, do not generate one.  This is the default mode.

      <listitem><para>

    <note>
    Note that formerly, this parameter was a boolean and permitted only values
    of <command>true</command> and <command>false</command>.  Boolean values
    will still be accepted but may eventually be deprecated. A value of
    <command>true</command> equates to <command>when-present</command>,
    <command>false</command> equates to <command>never</command>.
    </note>

      For example, To instruct kea-dhcp4 to always generate the FQDN for a
      client, set the parameter <command>replace-client-name</command> to
      <command>always</command> as follows:
      </para>
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {

        ...

    ...
}
</screen>
      <para>
      The prefix used in the generation of a FQDN is specified by the
      <command>generated-prefix</command> parameter.  The default value is "myhost".  To alter
      its value, simply set it to the desired string:
      </para>
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <userinput>"generated-prefix": "another.host"</userinput>,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
</screen>
      <para>
      The suffix used when generating a FQDN or when qualifying a
      partial name is specified by
      the <command>qualifying-suffix</command> parameter. This
      parameter has no default value, thus it is mandatory when
      DDNS updates are enabled.
      To set its value simply set it to the desired string:
      </para>
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "dhcp-ddns": {
        <userinput>"qualifying-suffix": "foo.example.org"</userinput>,

    },
    ...
}
</screen>
      </section>
      <para>
      When generating a name, kea-dhcp4 will construct name of the format:
      </para>
      <para>
        [generated-prefix]-[address-text].[qualifying-suffix].
      </para>
      <para>
      where address-text is simply the lease IP address converted to a
      hyphenated string.  For example, if the lease address is 172.16.1.10,
      the qualifying suffix "example.com", and the default value is used for
      <command>generated-prefix</command>, the generated FQDN would be:

      The value in subnet can be set to 0.0.0.0, which means that <command>next-server</command> should

      <title>Using Client Identifier and Hardware Address</title>

      why this identification is required and the most important ones are:

        <listitem><simpara>Some configurations use static reservations for the IP

        <listitem><simpara>In the dual stack networks there is often a need to
        correlate the lease information stored in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 server for
        a particular host. Using common identification information by the DHCPv4
        and DHCPv6 client allows the network administrator to achieve this
        correlation and better administer the network.</simpara></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>DHCPv4 makes use of two distinct identifiers which are placed
      by the client in the queries sent to the server and copied by the server
      to its responses to the client: "chaddr" and "client identifier". The
      former was introduced as a part of the BOOTP specification and it is also
      used by DHCP to carry the hardware address of the interface used to send
      the query to the server (MAC address for the Ethernet). The latter is
      carried in the Client-identifier option, introduced in
      <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2132">RFC 2132</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para><ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131">RFC 2131</ulink>
      indicates that the server may use both of these identifiers to identify
      the client but the "client identifier", if present, takes precedence
      over "chaddr". One of the reasons for this is that "client identifier"
      is independent from the hardware used by the client to communicate with
      the server. For example, if the client obtained the lease using one
      network card and then the network card is moved to another host, the
      server will wrongly identify this host is the one which has obtained
      the lease. Moreover,
      <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361">RFC 4361</ulink> gives
      the recommendation to use a DUID
      (see <ulink url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315">RFC 3315</ulink>,
      the DHCPv6 specification)
      carried as "client identifier" when dual stack networks are in use
      to provide consistent identification information of the client, regardless
      of the protocol type it is using. Kea adheres to these specifications and
      the "client identifier" by default takes precedence over the value carried
      in "chaddr" field when the server searches, creates, updates or removes
      the client's lease.
      </para>

      <para>When the server receives a DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST message from the
      client, it will try to find out if the client already has a lease in the
      database and will hand out that lease rather than allocate
      a new one. Each lease in the lease database is associated with the
      "client identifier" and/or "chaddr". The server will first use the
      "client identifier" (if present) to search the lease. If the lease is
      found, the server will treat this lease as belonging to the client
      even if the current "chaddr" and the "chaddr" associated with
      the lease do not match. This facilitates the scenario when the network card
      on the client system has been replaced and thus the new MAC address
      appears in the messages sent by the DHCP client. If the server fails
      to find the lease using the "client identifier" it will perform another lookup
      using the "chaddr". If this lookup returns no result, the client is
      considered as not having a lease and the new lease will be created.
      </para>

      <para>A common problem reported by network operators is that poor
      client implementations do not use stable client identifiers, instead
      generating a new "client identifier" each time the client connects
      to the network. Another well known case is when the client changes its
      "client identifier" during the multi-stage boot process (PXE). In such
      cases, the MAC address of the client's interface remains stable and
      using "chaddr" field to identify the client guarantees that the
      particular system is considered to be the same client, even though its
      "client identifier" changes.
      </para>

      <para>To address this problem, Kea includes a configuration option
      which enables client identification using "chaddr" only by instructing
      the server to disregard server to "ignore" the "client identifier" during
      lease lookups and allocations for a particular subnet. Consider the following
      simplified server configuration:</para>
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    ...
    <userinput>"match-client-id": true,</userinput>
    ...
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.10.0/24",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "192.0.2.23-192.0.2.87" } ],
        <userinput>"match-client-id": false</userinput>
    },
    {
        "subnet": "10.0.0.0/8",
        "pools": [ { "pool": "10.0.0.23-10.0.2.99" } ],
    }
    ]
}
</screen>

     <para>The <command>match-client-id</command> is a boolean value which
     controls this behavior. The default value of <userinput>true</userinput>
     indicates that the server will use the "client identifier" for lease
     lookups and "chaddr" if the first lookup returns no results. The
     <command>false</command> means that the server will only
     use the "chaddr" to search for client"s lease. Whether the DHCID for
     DNS updates is generated from the "client identifier" or "chaddr" is
     controlled through the same parameter accordingly.</para>

     <para>The <command>match-client-id</command> parameter may appear
     both in the global configuration scope and/or under any subnet
     declaration. In the example shown above, the effective value of the
     <command>match-client-id</command> will be <userinput>false</userinput>
     for the subnet 192.0.10.0/24, because the subnet specific setting
     of the parameter overrides the global value of the parameter. The
     effective value of the <command>match-client-id</command> for the subnet
     10.0.0.0/8 will be set to <userinput>true</userinput> because the
     subnet declaration lacks this parameter and the global setting is
     by default used for this subnet. In fact, the global entry for this
     parameter could be omitted in this case, because
     <userinput>true</userinput> is the default value.
     </para>

     <para>It is important to explain what happens when the client obtains
     its lease for one setting of the <command>match-client-id</command>
     and then renews when the setting has been changed. First consider
     the case when the client obtains the lease when the
     <command>match-client-id</command> is set to <userinput>true</userinput>.
     The server will store the lease information including "client identifier"
     (if supplied) and "chaddr" in the lease database. When the setting is
     changed and the client renews the lease the server will determine that
     it should use the "chaddr" to search for the existing lease. If the
     client hasn't changed its MAC address the server should successfully
     find the existing lease. The "client identifier" associated with the
     returned lease is ignored and the client is allowed to use this lease.
     When the lease is renewed only the "chaddr" is recorded for this
     lease according to the new server setting.
     </para>

     <para>In the second case the client has the lease with only a "chaddr"
     value recorded. When the setting is changed to
     <command>match-client-id</command> set to <userinput>true</userinput>
     the server will first try to use the "client identifier" to find the
     existing client's lease. This will return no results because the
     "client identifier" was not recorded for this lease. The server will
     then use the "chaddr" and the lease will be found. If the lease appears
     to have no "client identifier" recorded, the server will assume that
     this lease belongs to the client and that it was created with the previous
     setting of the <command>match-client-id</command>.
     However, if the lease contains "client identifier" which is different
     from the "client identifier" used by the client the lease will be
     assumed to belong to another client and the new lease will be
     allocated.

  <section id="host-reservation-v4">
    <title>Host Reservation in DHCPv4</title>

    <para>There are many cases where it is useful to provide a configuration on
    a per host basis. The most obvious one is to reserve a specific, static
    address for exclusive use by a given client (host) &dash; the returning client will
    receive the same address from the server every time, and other clients will
    generally not receive that address.
    Another example when the host reservations are applicable is when a host
    has specific requirements, e.g. a printer that needs additional DHCP options.
    Yet another possible use case is to define unique names for hosts.</para>

    <para>Note that there may be cases when the
    new reservation has been made for the client for the address being currently
    in use by another client. We call this situation a "conflict". The conflicts
    get resolved automatically over time as described in subsequent sections.
    Once the conflict is resolved, the client will keep receiving the reserved
    configuration when it renews.</para>

    <para>Host reservations are defined as parameters for each subnet. Each host
    has to be identified by an identifier, for example the hardware/MAC address. There is an optional
    <command>reservations</command> array in the <command>Subnet4</command>
    element. Each element in that array is a structure that holds information
    about reservations for a single host. In particular, the structure has
    to have an identifier that uniquely identifies a host.  In the DHCPv4 context, the
    identifier is usually a hardware or MAC address.  In most cases an IP address
    will be specified. It is also possible to specify a hostname, host
    specific options or fields carried within DHCPv4 message such as siaddr,
    sname or file.</para>

    <para>In Kea 1.0.0 it was only possible to create host reservations
    using client's hardware address. Host reservations by client
    identifier, DUID and circuit-id have been added in Kea 1.1.0.</para>

    <para>The following example shows how to reserve addresses for specific
    hosts:

<screen>
"subnet4": [
    {
        "pools": [ { "pool":  "192.0.2.1 - 192.0.2.200" } ],
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        "interface": "eth0",
        <userinput>"reservations": [
            {
                "hw-address": "1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f",
                "ip-address": "192.0.2.202"
            },
            {
                "duid": "0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f",
                "ip-address": "192.0.2.100",
                "hostname": "alice-laptop"
            },
            {
                "circuit-id": "'charter950'",
                "ip-address": "192.0.2.203"
            },
            {
                "client-id": "01:11:22:33:44:55:66",
                "ip-address": "192.0.2.204"
            }
        ]</userinput>
    }
]
</screen>
    The first entry reserves the 192.0.2.202 address for the client that uses
    a MAC address of 1a:1b:1c:1d:1e:1f. The second entry reserves the address
    192.0.2.100 and the hostname of alice-laptop for the client using a DUID
    0a:0b:0c:0d:0e:0f. (Note that if you plan to do DNS updates, it
    is strongly recommended for the hostnames to be unique.) The third
    example reserves address 192.0.3.203 to a client whose request
    would be relayed by a relay agent that inserts a circuid-it option
    with the value 'charter950'. The fourth entry reserves address
    192.0.2.204 for a client that uses a client identifier with value
    01:11:22:33:44:55:66.</para>

    <para>The above example is used for ilustrational purposes only
    and in actual deployments it is recommended to use as few types as possible
    (preferably just one). See <xref linkend="reservations4-tuning"/> for a detailed
    discussion of this point.</para>

    <para>Making a reservation for a mobile host that may visit multiple subnets
    requires a separate host definition in each subnet it is expected to visit.
    It is not allowed to define multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address in a single subnet. Multiple host definitions with the same hardware
    address are valid if each is in a different subnet.
    </para>

    <para>Adding host reservation incurs a performance penalty. In principle,
    when a server that does not support host reservation responds to a query,
    it needs to check whether there is a lease for a given address being
    considered for allocation or renewal. The server that also supports host
    reservation has to perform additional checks: not only if the address is
    currently used (i.e. if there is a lease for it), but also whether the address
    could be used by someone else (i.e. there is a reservation for it). That
    additional check incurs additional overhead.</para>

    <section id="reservation4-types">
      <title>Address Reservation Types</title>

      <para>In a typical scenario there is an IPv4 subnet defined,
      e.g. 192.0.2.0/24, with certain part of it dedicated for dynamic allocation
      by the DHCPv4 server. That dynamic part is referred to as a dynamic pool or
      simply a pool. In principle, a host reservation can reserve any address
      that belongs to the subnet. The reservations that specify addresses that
      belong to configured pools are called "in-pool reservations".
      In contrast, those that do not belong to dynamic pools are called
      "out-of-pool reservations". There is no formal difference
      in the reservation syntax and both reservation types are
      handled uniformly. However, upcoming releases may offer improved performance
      if there are only out-of-pool reservations as the server will be able
      to skip reservation checks when dealing with existing leases. Therefore,
      system administrators are encouraged to use out-of-pool reservations if
      possible.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="reservation4-conflict">
      <title>Conflicts in DHCPv4 Reservations</title>
      <para>As the reservations and lease information are stored separately,
      conflicts may arise. Consider the following series of events. The server
      has configured the dynamic pool of addresses from the range of 192.0.2.10 to
      192.0.2.20. Host A requests an address and gets 192.0.2.10. Now the system
      administrator decides to reserve address 192.0.2.10 for Host B.
      In general, reserving an address that
      is currently assigned to someone else is not recommended, but there are
      valid use cases where such an operation is warranted.</para>

      <para>The server now has a conflict to resolve. Let's analyze the
      situation here. If Host B boots up and requests an address, the server is
      not able to assign the reserved address 192.0.2.10. A naive approach
      would to be immediately remove the existing lease for the Host A
      and create a new one for the Host B. That would not solve the problem,
      though, because as soon as the Host B gets the address, it will detect
      that the address is already in use by the Host A and would send
      the DHCPDECLINE message. Therefore, in this situation, the server has
      to temporarily assign a different address (not matching what has been
      reserved) to the Host B.</para>

      <!-- let's keep this text around. It describes how that is working in v6
      <para>When the Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for someone else (host
      B). Therefore the server will remove the lease and will inform the Host A
      that it is no longer allowed to use it by sending DHCPNAK message. Host A
      will then revert to server discovery and will eventually get a different
      address.  The address 192.0.2.10 is now no longer used. When host B tries
      to renew its temporarily assigned  address, the server will detect that
      it has a valid lease, but there is a reservation for a different address.
      The server will send DHCPNAK to inform host B that its address is no
      longer usable. The server will also remove its temporary lease. It will
      revert to the server discovery phase and will eventually send a
      DHCPREQUEST message. This time the server will find out that there is a
      reservation for that host and the reserved address 192.0.2.10 is not used,
      so it will be granted.</para> -->

      <para>When Host A renews its address, the server will discover that
      the address being renewed is now reserved for another host - Host
      B. Therefore the server will inform the Host A that it is no longer
      allowed to use it by sending a DHCPNAK message. The server will not remove the
      lease, though, as there's small chance that the DHCPNAK may be lost if the
      network is lossy. If that happens, the client will not receive any
      responses, so it will retransmit its DHCPREQUEST packet. Once the
      DHCPNAK is received by Host A, it will revert to the server
      discovery and will eventually get a different address. Besides
      allocating a new lease, the server will also remove the old one. As
      a result, address 192.0.2.10 will become free . When Host B
      tries to renew its temporarily assigned address, the server will detect
      that it has a valid lease, but there is a reservation for a different
      address. The server will send DHCPNAK to inform Host B that its address
      is no longer usable, but will keep its lease (again, the DHCPNAK may be
      lost, so the server will keep it, until the client returns for a new
      address). Host B will revert to the server discovery phase and will
      eventually send a DHCPREQUEST message. This time the server will find
      out that there is a reservation for that host and the reserved address
      192.0.2.10 is not used, so it will be granted. It will also remove the
      lease for the temporarily assigned address that Host B previously
      obtained.</para>

      <para>This recovery will succeed, even if other hosts will attempt to get
      the reserved address. Had the Host C requested address 192.0.2.10 after
      the reservation was made, the server will either offer a different
      address (when responding to DHCPDISCOVER) or would send DHCPNAK
      (when responding to DHCPREQUEST).</para>

      <para>This recovery mechanism allows the server to fully recover from a
      case where reservations conflict with the existing leases. This procedure
      takes time and will roughly take as long as the value set for of renew-timer.
      The best way to avoid such recovery is to not define new reservations that
      conflict with existing leases. Another recommendation is to use
      out-of-pool reservations. If the reserved address does not belong to a
      pool, there is no way that other clients could get this address.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="reservation4-hostname">
      <title>Reserving a Hostname</title>
      <para>When the reservation for a client includes the <command>hostname</command>,
      the server will return this hostname to the client in
      the Client FQDN or Hostname options. The server responds with the Client
      FQDN option only if the client has included Client FQDN option in its
      message to the server. The server will respond with the Hostname option
      if the client included Hostname option in its message to the server
      or when the client requested Hostname option using Parameter Request
      List option. The server will return the Hostname option even if it is not
      configured to perform DNS updates. The reserved hostname always takes
      precedence over the hostname supplied by the client or the autogenerated
      (from the IPv4 address) hostname.</para>

      <para>The server qualifies the reserved hostname with the value
      of the <command>qualifying-suffix</command> parameter. For example, the
      following subnet configuration:
<screen>
    {
        "subnet4": [ {
            "subnet": "10.0.0.0/24",

               }
            ]
         }],
        "dhcp-ddns": {
            "enable-updates": true,
            "qualifying-suffix": "example.isc.org."
        }
    }
</screen>
      will result in assigning the "alice-laptop.example.isc.org." hostname to the
      client using the MAC address "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff". If the <command>qualifying-suffix
      </command> is not specified, the default (empty) value will be used, and
      in this case the value specified as a <command>hostname</command> will
      be treated as fully qualified name. Thus, by leaving the
      <command>qualifying-suffix</command> empty it is possible to qualify
      hostnames for the different clients with different domain names:

      <title>Fine Tuning DHCPv4 Host Reservation</title>

      <para>The host reservation capability introduces additional restrictions for the
      allocation engine (the component of Kea that selects an address for a client)
      during lease selection and renewal. In particular, three
      major checks are necessary. First, when selecting a new lease, it is not
      sufficient for a candidate lease to not be used by another DHCP client. It
      also must not be reserved for another client. Second, when renewing a lease,
      additional check must be performed whether the address being renewed is not
      reserved for another client. Finally, when a host renews an address, the server
      has to check whether there is a reservation for this host, so the existing
      (dynamically allocated) address should be revoked and the reserved one be
      used instead.
      </para>
      <para>Some of those checks may be unnecessary in certain deployments and not
      performing them may improve performance. The Kea server provides the
      <command>reservation-mode</command> configuration parameter to select the
      types of reservations allowed for the particular subnet. Each reservation
      type has different constraints for the checks to be performed by the
      server when allocating or renewing a lease for the client.
      Allowed values are:

      <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara> <command>all</command> - enables all host reservation
      types. This is the default value. This setting is the safest and the most
      flexible. It allows in-pool and out-of-pool reservations. As all checks
      are conducted, it is also the slowest.
      </simpara></listitem>

      <listitem><simpara> <command>out-of-pool</command> - allows only out of
      pool host reservations.  With this setting in place, the server may assume
      that all host reservations are for addresses that do not belong to the
      dynamic pool. Therefore it can skip the reservation checks when dealing
      with in-pool addresses, thus improving performance. Do not use this mode
      if any of your reservations use in-pool address. Caution is advised when
      using this setting: Kea 1.1.0 does not sanity check the reservations against
      <command>reservation-mode</command> and misconfiguration may cause problems.
      </simpara></listitem>

      <listitem><simpara>
      <command>disabled</command> - host reservation support is disabled. As there
      are no reservations, the server will skip all checks. Any reservations defined
      will be completely ignored. As the checks are skipped, the server may
      operate faster in this mode.
      </simpara></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
        An example configuration that disables reservation looks like follows:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "subnet4": [
    {
        "subnet": "192.0.2.0/24",
        <userinput>"reservation-mode": "disabled"</userinput>,
        ...
    }
    ]
}
</screen>
      </para>

      <para>Another aspect of the host reservations are the different types of
      identifiers. Kea 1.1.0 supports four types of identifiers
      (hw-address, duid, client-id and circuit-id), but more identifier types
      are likely to be added in the future. This is beneficial from a
      usability perspective. However, there is a drawback. For each incoming
      packet Kea has to to extract each identifier type and then query the
      database to see if there is a reservation done by this particular
      identifier. If nothing is found, the next identifier is extracted and the next
      query is issued. This process continues until either a reservation is
      found or all identifier types have been checked. Over time with an increasing
      number of supported identifier types, Kea would become slower and
      slower.</para>

      <para>To address this problem, a parameter called
      <command>host-reservation-identifiers</command> has been introduced. It
      takes a list of identifier types as a parameter. Kea will check only those
      identifier types enumerated in host-reservation-identifiers. From a
      performance perspective the number of identifier types should be kept to a
      minimum, ideally limited to one. If your deployment uses several
      reservation types, please enumerate them from most to least frequently
      used as this increases the chances of Kea finding the reservation using the
      fewest number of queries. An example of host reservation identifiers looks
      as follows:

<screen>
<userinput>"host-reservation-identifiers": [ "circuit-id", "hw-address", "duid", "client-id" ],</userinput>
"subnet4": [
    {

        ...
    }
]</screen>
</para>

      <title>Server Identifier in DHCPv4</title>
      <para>
        The DHCPv4 protocol uses a "server identifier" to allow clients
        to discriminate between several servers present on the same link: this
        value is an IPv4 address of the server. The server chooses the IPv4 address
        of the interface on which the message from the client (or relay) has been
        received. A single server instance will use multiple server identifiers
        if it is receiving queries on multiple interfaces.
      </para>
      <para>
        Currently there is no mechanism to override the default server identifiers
        by an administrator. In the future, the configuration mechanism will be used
        to specify the custom server identifier.

      <title>How the DHCPv4 Server Selects a Subnet for the Client</title>
      <para>
        The DHCPv4 server differentiates between the directly connected clients,
        clients trying to renew leases and clients sending their messages through
        relays. For directly connected clients, the server will check the
        configuration for the interface on which the message has been received and,
        if the server configuration doesn't match any configured subnet, the
        message is discarded.</para>
        <para>Assuming that the server's interface is configured with the
        IPv4 address 192.0.2.3, the server will only process messages received through
        this interface from a directly connected client if there is a subnet
        configured to which this IPv4 address belongs, e.g. 192.0.2.0/24.
        The server will use this subnet to assign IPv4 address for the client.
      </para>
      <para>
        The rule above does not apply when the client unicasts its message, i.e.
        is trying to renew its lease. Such a message is accepted through any
        interface. The renewing client sets ciaddr to the currently used IPv4
        address. The server uses this address to select the subnet for the client
        (in particular, to extend the lease using this address).
      </para>
      <para>
        If the message is relayed it is accepted through any interface. The giaddr
        set by the relay agent is used to select the subnet for the client.
      </para>
      <para>
        It is also possible to specify a relay IPv4 address for a given subnet. It
        can be used to match incoming packets into a subnet in uncommon configurations,
        e.g. shared subnets. See <xref linkend="dhcp4-relay-override"/> for details.
      </para>
      <note>
        <para>The subnet selection mechanism described in this section is based
        on the assumption that client classification is not used. The classification
        mechanism alters the way in which a subnet is selected for the client,
        depending on the classes to which the client belongs.</para>

    <section id="dhcp4-relay-override">
      <title>Using a Specific Relay Agent for a Subnet</title>
      <para>
        A relay has to have an interface connected to the link on which
        the clients are being configured. Typically the relay has an IPv4
        address configured on that interface that belongs to the subnet from which
        the server will assign addresses. In the typical case, the
        server is able to use the IPv4 address inserted by the relay (in the giaddr
        field of the DHCPv4 packet) to select the appropriate subnet.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, that is not always the case. In certain uncommon &mdash;
        but valid &mdash; deployments, the relay address may not match the subnet. This
        usually means that there is more than one subnet allocated for a given
        link. The two most common examples where this is the case are long lasting
        network renumbering (where both old and new address space is still being
        used) and a cable network. In a cable network both cable modems and the
        devices behind them are physically connected to the same link, yet
        they use distinct addressing. In such a case, the DHCPv4 server needs
        additional information (the IPv4 address of the relay) to properly select
        an appropriate subnet.
      </para>
      <para>
        The following example assumes that there is a subnet 192.0.2.0/24
        that is accessible via a relay that uses 10.0.0.1 as its IPv4 address.
        The server will be able to select this subnet for any incoming packets
        that came from a relay that has an address in 192.0.2.0/24 subnet.
        It will also select that subnet for a relay with address 10.0.0.1.

      <title>Duplicate Addresses (DHCPDECLINE Support)</title>

      <para>The DHCPv4 server is configured with a certain pool of addresses
      that it is expected to hand out to the DHCPv4 clients.  It is
      assumed that the server is authoritative and has complete jurisdiction
      over those addresses. However, due to various reasons, such as
      misconfiguration or a faulty client implementation that retains its
      address beyond the valid lifetime, there may be devices connected that use
      those addresses without the server's approval or knowledge.</para>

      <para>Such an
      unwelcome event can be detected by legitimate clients (using ARP or ICMP
      Echo Request mechanisms) and reported to the DHCPv4 server using a DHCPDECLINE
      message. The server will do a sanity check (if the client declining an
      address really was supposed to use it), and then will conduct a clean up
      operation. Any DNS entries related to that address will be removed, the
      fact will be logged and hooks will be triggered. After that is done, the
      address will be marked as declined (which indicates that it is used by an
      unknown entity and thus not available for assignment to anyone) and a
      probation time will be set on it. Unless otherwise configured, the
      probation period lasts 24 hours. After that period, the server will
      recover the lease (i.e. put it back into the available state) and the address will
      be available for assignment again. It should be noted that if the
      underlying issue of a misconfigured device is not resolved, the duplicate
      address scenario will repeat. On the other hand, it provides an
      opportunity to recover from such an event automatically, without any
      sysadmin intervention.</para>

      <para>To configure the decline probation period to a value other
      than the default, the following syntax can be used:
<screen>
  "Dhcp4": {
    <userinput>"decline-probation-period": 3600</userinput>,
    "subnet4": [ ... ],
    ...
}
</screen>
      The parameter is expressed in seconds, so the example above will instruct
      the server to recycle declined leases after an hour.</para>

      <para>There are several statistics and hook points associated with the
      Decline handling procedure. The lease4_decline hook is triggered after the
      incoming DHCPDECLINE message has been sanitized and the server is about to
      decline the lease. The declined-addresses statistic is increased after the
      hook returns (both global and subnet specific variants). (See
      <xref linkend="dhcp4-stats"/> and <xref linkend="hooks-libraries"/> for more details
      on DHCPv4 statistics and Kea hook points.)</para>

      <para>Once the probation time elapses, the declined lease is recovered
      using the standard expired lease reclamation procedure, with several
      additional steps. In particular, both declined-addresses statistics
      (global and subnet specific) are decreased. At the same time,
      reclaimed-declined-addresses statistics (again in two variants, global and
      subnet specific) are increased.</para>

      <para>Note about statistics: The server does not decrease the
      assigned-addresses statistics when a DHCPDECLINE is received and processed
      successfully. While technically a declined address is no longer assigned,
      the primary usage of the assigned-addresses statistic is to monitor pool
      utilization. Most people would forget to include declined-addresses in the
      calculation, and simply do assigned-addresses/total-addresses. This would
      have a bias towards under-representing pool utilization. As this has a
      potential for major issues, we decided not to decrease assigned addresses
      immediately after receiving DHCPDECLINE, but to do it later when we
      recover the address back to the available pool.</para>

        The management API allows the issuing of specific
        management commands, such as statistics retrieval, reconfiguration or shutdown.
        For more details, see <xref linkend="ctrl-channel" />. Currently the only
        supported communication channel type is UNIX stream socket. By default there
        are no sockets open. To instruct Kea to open a socket, the following entry
        in the configuration file can be used:
<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    "control-socket": {
        "socket-type": "unix",
        "socket-name": <userinput>"/path/to/the/unix/socket"</userinput>
    },

    "subnet4": [

}
</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        The length of the path specified by the <command>socket-name</command>
        parameter is restricted by the maximum length for the unix socket name
        on your operating system, i.e. the size of the <command>sun_path</command>
        field in the <command>sockaddr_un</command> structure, decreased by 1.
        This value varies on different operating systems between 91 and 107
        characters. Typical values are 107 on Linux and 103 on FreeBSD.

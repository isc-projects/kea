/// \brief Buffering Logger Appender
///
/// This class can be set as an Appender for log4cplus loggers,
/// and is used to store logging events; it simply keeps any
/// event that is passed to \c append(), and will replay them to the
/// logger that they were originally created for when \c flush() is
/// called.
///
/// The idea is that initially, a program may want to do some logging,
/// but does not know where to yet (for instance because it has yet to
/// read and parse its configuration). Any log messages before this time
/// would normally go to some default (say, stdout), and be lost in the
/// real logging destination. By buffering them (and flushing them once
/// the logger has been configured), these log messages are kept in a
/// consistent place, and are not lost.
///
/// Given this goal, this class has an extra check; it will raise
/// an exception if \c append() is called after flush().
///
/// If the BufferAppender instance is destroyed before being flushed,
/// it will dump any event it has left to stdout.

.SH "NAME"
b10-stats \- BIND 10 statistics module
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-stats\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-stats\fR [\fB\-v\fR] [\fB\-\-verbose\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-stats\fR
is a daemon forked by
\fBbind10\fR\&. Stats module collects statistics data from each module and reports statistics information via
\fBbindctl\fR\&. It communicates by using the Command Channel by
\fBb10\-msgq\fR
with other modules like
\fBbind10\fR,
\fBb10\-auth\fR
and so on\&. It waits for coming data from other modules, then other modules send data to stats module periodically\&. Other modules send stats data to stats module independently from implementation of stats module, so the frequency of sending data may not be constant\&. Stats module collects data and aggregates it\&.
\fBb10\-stats\fR
invokes an internal command for
\fBbind10\fR
after its initial starting because it\'s sure to collect statistics data from
\fBbind10\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
This
\fBb10\-stats\fR
switches to verbose mode\&. It sends verbose messages to STDOUT\&.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND COMMANDS"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-stats\fR
command does not have any configurable settings\&.
.PP
The configuration commands are:
.PP

\fBset\fR
will set new statistics data specified in arguments\&. Statistics data to be set and the module name which owns statistics data are required in argument\&. Pid of the module in argument is optional\&.
.PP

\fBshow\fR
will send the statistics data in JSON format\&. By default, it outputs all the statistics data it has collected\&. An optional item name may be specified to receive individual output\&.
.PP

\fBshowschema\fR
will send the schema of the statistics data in JSON format\&. The output is equivalent to the statistics part of
stats\&.spec\&.
.PP

\fBshutdown\fR
will shutdown the
\fBb10\-stats\fR
process\&. This has an optional
\fIpid\fR
argument to select the process ID to stop\&. (Note that the BIND 10 boss process may restart this service if configured\&.)
.PP

\fBstatus\fR
simply indicates that the daemon is running\&.
.SH "STATISTICS DATA"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-stats\fR
daemon contains these
\(lqStats\(rq
statistics:
.PP
boot_time
.RS 4
The date and time when this daemon was started in ISO 8601 format\&. This is a constant which can\'t be reset except by restarting
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
last_update_time
.RS 4
The date and time (in ISO 8601 format) when this daemon last received data from another component\&.
.RE
.PP
lname
.RS 4
This is the name used for the
\fBb10\-msgq\fR
command\-control channel\&. (This is a constant which can\'t be reset except by restarting
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.)
.RE
.PP
report_time
.RS 4
The latest report date and time in ISO 8601 format\&.
.RE
.PP
start_time
.RS 4
This is the date and time (in ISO 8601 format) when this daemon started collecting data\&.
.RE
.PP
timestamp
.RS 4
The current date and time represented in seconds since UNIX epoch (1970\-01\-01T00:00:00Z) with precision (delimited with a period) up to one hundred thousandth of second\&.
.RE
.PP
See other manual pages for explanations for their statistics that are kept track by
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&.
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/usr/local/share/bind10\-devel/stats\&.spec
\(em This is a spec file for
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&. It contains commands for
\fBb10\-stats\fR\&. They can be invoked via
bindctl(1)\&.

/// \brief The \c DNSServer class is a wrapper (and base class) for
/// classes which provide DNS server functionality.
/// 
/// The classes derived from this one, \c TCPServer and \c UDPServer,
/// act as the interface layer between clients sending queries, and
/// functions defined elsewhere that provide answers to those queries.
/// Those functions are described in more detail below under
/// \c SimpleCallback, \c DNSLookup, and \c DNSAnswer.
///
/// Notes to developers:
/// When constructed, this class (and its derived classes) will have its
/// "self_" member set to point to "this".  Objects of this class (as
/// instantiated through a base class) are sometimes passed by
/// reference (as this superclass); calls to methods in the base
/// class are then rerouted via this pointer to methods in the derived
/// class.  This allows code from outside asiolink, with no specific
/// knowledge of \c TCPServer or \c UDPServer, to access their methods.
///
/// This class is both assignable and copy-constructable.  Its subclasses
/// use the "stackless coroutine" pattern, meaning that it will copy itself
/// when "forking", and that instances will be posted as ASIO handler
/// objects, which are always copied.
///
/// Because these objects are frequently copied, it is recommended 
/// that derived classes be kept small to reduce copy overhead.

/// Notes to developers: Internally, a name object maintains the name %data

/// implementations adopt copy-on-write %data sharing, we expect this approach
/// will make copying a name less expensive in typical cases.  If this is
/// found to be a significant performance bottleneck later, we may reconsider
/// the internal representation or perhaps the API.
///
/// A name object also maintains a vector of offsets (\c offsets_ member),
/// each of which is the offset to a label of the name: The n-th element of
/// the vector specifies the offset to the n-th label.  For example, if the
/// object represents "www.example.com", the elements of the offsets vector
/// are 0, 4, 12, and 16.  Note that the offset to the trailing dot (16) is
/// included.  In the BIND9 DNS library from which this implementation is
/// derived, the offsets are optional, probably due to performance
/// considerations (in fact, offsets can always be calculated from the name
/// %data, and in that sense are redundant).  In our implementation, however,
/// we always build and maintain the offsets.  We believe we need more low
/// level, specialized %data structure and interface where we really need to
/// pursue performance, and would rather keep this generic API and
/// implementation simpler.
///
/// While many other DNS APIs introduce an "absolute or relative"
/// attribute of names as defined in RFC1035, names are always "absolute" in
/// the initial design of this API.
/// In fact, separating absolute and relative would confuse API users
/// unnecessarily.  For example, it's not so intuitive to consider the
/// comparison result of an absolute name with a relative name.
/// We've looked into how the concept of absolute names is used in BIND9,
/// and found that in many cases names are generally absolute.
/// The only reasonable case of separating absolute and relative is in a master
/// file parser, where a relative name must be a complete name with an "origin"
/// name, which must be absolute.  So, in this initial design, we chose a
/// simpler approach: the API generally handles names as absolute; when we
/// introduce a parser of master files, we'll introduce the notion of relative

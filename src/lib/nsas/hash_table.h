     * It is performed attomically to prevent race conditions.

     *     will be added and returned. The generator should return as soon
     *     as possible, the slot is locked during its execution.

     *     means new value, false looked up one). The other part is the
     *     object, either found or created.

     *     could split it to fast-slow path - first try to find it with
     *     shared_lock. If it fails, lock by scoped_lock, try to find again (we
     *     unlocked it, so it might have appeared) and if it still isn't there,
     *     create it. Not implemented now as it might or might not help (it
     *     could even slow it down) and the code would get more complicated.

% COMMAND_ACCEPTOR_START Starting to accept connections via unix domain socket bound to %1
This informational message is issued when the Kea server starts an acceptor
via which it is going to accept new control connections. The acceptor is
bound to the endpoint associated with the filename provided as an argument.
If starting the acceptor fails, subsequent error messages will provide a
reason for failure.

% COMMAND_DEREGISTERED Command %1 deregistered
This debug message indicates that the daemon stopped supporting specified
command. This command can no longer be issued. If the command socket is
open and this command is issued, the daemon will not be able to process it.

% COMMAND_EXTENDED_REGISTERED Command %1 registered
This debug message indicates that the daemon started supporting specified
command. The handler for the registered command includes a parameter holding
entire command to be processed.

% COMMAND_PROCESS_ERROR1 Error while processing command: %1
This warning message indicates that the server encountered an error while
processing received command. Additional information will be provided, if
available. Additional log messages may provide more details.

% COMMAND_PROCESS_ERROR2 Error while processing command: %1
This warning message indicates that the server encountered an error while
processing received command. The difference, compared to COMMAND_PROCESS_ERROR1
is that the initial command was well formed and the error occurred during
logic processing, not the command parsing. Additional information will be
provided, if available. Additional log messages may provide more details.

% COMMAND_RECEIVED Received command '%1'
This informational message indicates that a command was received over command
socket. The nature of this command and its possible results will be logged
with separate messages.

% COMMAND_REGISTERED Command %1 registered
This debug message indicates that the daemon started supporting specified
command. If the command socket is open, this command can now be issued.

% COMMAND_RESPONSE_ERROR Server failed to generate response for command: %1
This error message indicates that the server failed to generate response for
specified command. This likely indicates a server logic error, as the server
is expected to generate valid responses for all commands, even malformed
ones.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_ACCEPT_FAIL Failed to accept incoming connection on command socket %1: %2
This error indicates that the server detected incoming connection and executed
accept system call on said socket, but this call returned an error. Additional
information may be provided by the system as second parameter.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CLOSED_BY_FOREIGN_HOST Closed command socket %1 by foreign host, %2
This is an information message indicating that the command connection has been
closed by a command control client, and whether or not any partially read data
was discarded.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_CANCEL_FAIL Failed to cancel read operation on socket %1: %2
This error message is issued to indicate an error to cancel asynchronous read
of the control command over the control socket. The cancel operation is performed
when the timeout occurs during communication with a client. The error message
includes details about the reason for failure.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_CLOSED Closed socket %1 for existing command connection
This is a debug message indicating that the socket created for handling
client's connection is closed. This usually means that the client disconnected,
but may also mean a timeout.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_CLOSE_FAIL Failed to close command connection: %1
This error message is issued when an error occurred when closing a
command connection and/or removing it from the connections pool. The
detailed error is provided as an argument.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_OPENED Opened socket %1 for incoming command connection
This is a debug message indicating that a new incoming command connection was
detected and a dedicated socket was opened for that connection.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_SHUTDOWN_FAIL Encountered error %1 while trying to gracefully shutdown socket
This message indicates an error while trying to gracefully shutdown command
connection. The type of the error is included in the message.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Timeout occurred for connection over socket %1
This is an informational message that indicates that the timeout has
occurred for one of the command channel connections. The response
sent by the server indicates a timeout and is then closed.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_READ Received %1 bytes over command socket %2
This debug message indicates that specified number of bytes was received
over command socket identified by specified file descriptor.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_READ_FAIL Encountered error %1 while reading from command socket %2
This error message indicates that an error was encountered while
reading from command socket.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_WRITE Sent response of %1 bytes (%2 bytes left to send) over command socket %3
This debug message indicates that the specified number of bytes was sent
over command socket identifier by the specified file descriptor.

% COMMAND_SOCKET_WRITE_FAIL Error while writing to command socket %1 : %2
This error message indicates that an error was encountered while
attempting to send a response to the command socket.

% COMMAND_WATCH_SOCKET_CLEAR_ERROR watch socket failed to clear: %1
This error message is issued when the command manager was unable to reset
the ready status after completing a send. This is a programmatic error
that should be reported. The command manager may or may not continue
to operate correctly.

% COMMAND_WATCH_SOCKET_CLOSE_ERROR watch socket failed to close: %1
This error message is issued when command manager attempted to close the
socket used for indicating the ready status for send operations. This
should not have any negative impact on the operation of the command
manager as it happens when the connection is being terminated.

% COMMAND_WATCH_SOCKET_MARK_READY_ERROR watch socket failed to mark ready: %1
This error message is issued when the command manager was unable to set
ready status after scheduling asynchronous send. This is programmatic error
that should be reported. The command manager may or may not continue
to operate correctly.

1. Zonemgr should support adding/deleting zones dynamically.
2. Make zonemgr  has customizable configurations for LOWERBOUND_REFRESH, LOWERBOUND_RETRY, MAX_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT, REFRESH_OFFSET, RETRY_OFFSET, EXPIRED_OFFSET, and/or jitter?
3. There should be one way to see the current counters/timers and other data for each zone managed by zonemgr.
4. There should be one way to turn off zonemgr.(Does user really need it? not sure what's the purpose of user)

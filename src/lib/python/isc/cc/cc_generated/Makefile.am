# This makefile is a hack to enable tests to run with one module generated
# while the rest is just used. The generated file is created under build dir,
# not the src dir, which means it is not found when these are different.
#
# We have a forwarder module in the src dir and build the real one in different
# location. This is similar to what happens in log_messages/work. We can't
# reuse the name `work`, since it would collide, so we use less generic name.

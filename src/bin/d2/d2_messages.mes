A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND10 control system by the controller.

% DCTL_CONFIG_COMPLETE server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. It is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DCTL_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL %1 configuration failed to load: %2
This critical error message indicates that the initial application
configuration has failed. The service will start, but will not
process requests until the configuration has been corrected.

This debug message is issued when the dummy handler for configuration
events is called.  This only happens during initial startup.

% DCTL_CONFIG_UPDATE %1 updated configuration received: %2
A debug message indicating that the controller has received an
updated configuration from the BIND10 configuration system.

% DCTL_DISCONNECT_FAIL %1 controller failed to end session with BIND10: %2
This message indicates that while shutting down, the Dhcp-Ddns controller
encountered an error terminating communication with the BIND10. The service
will still exit.  While theoretically possible, this situation is rather
unlikely.

application when it is not running.

% DCTL_ORDER_ERROR configuration contains more elements than the parsing order
An error message which indicates that configuration being parsed includes
element ids not specified the configuration manager's parse order list. This
is a programmatic error.

% DCTL_ORDER_NO_ELEMENT element: %1 is in the parsing order but is missing from the configuration
An error message output during a configuration update.  The program is
expecting an item but has not found it in the new configuration.  This may
mean that the BIND 10 configuration database is corrupt.

% DCTL_PARSER_FAIL configuration parsing failed for configuration element: %1, reason: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of the named
configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the parsing actions
and committal of changes failed.  The reason for the failure is given in
the message.

This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application command method
has been invoked.

% DHCP_DDNS_CONFIGURE configuration update received: %1
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application configure method
has been invoked.

% DHCP_DDNS_FAILED application experienced a fatal error: %1
This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application encounters an
unrecoverable error from within the event loop.

% DHCP_DDNS_INVALID_RESPONSE received response to DNS Update message is malformed: %1
This is a debug message issued when the DHCP-DDNS application encountered an
error while decoding a response to DNS Update message. Typically, this error
will be encountered when a response message is malformed.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_ELIGIBLE_JOBS although there are queued requests, there are pending transactions for each Queue count: %1  Transaction count: %2
This is a debug messge issued when all of the queued requests represent clients
for which there is a an update already in progress.  This may occur under
normal operations but should be temporary situation.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_FWD_MATCH_ERROR the configured list of forward DDNS domains does not contain a match for FQDN %1  The request has been discarded.
This is an error message that indicates that DHCP_DDNS received a request to
update a the forward DNS information for the given FQDN but for which there are
no configured DDNS domains in the DHCP_DDNS configuration.  Either the DHCP_DDNS
configuration needs to be updated or the source of the FQDN itself should be
investigated.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_MATCH No DNS servers match FQDN %1
This is warning message issued when there are no domains in the configuration
which match the cited fully qualified domain name (FQDN).  The DNS Update
request for the FQDN cannot be processed.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_REV_MATCH_ERROR the configured list of reverse DDNS domains does not contain a match for FQDN %1  The request has been discarded.
This is an error message that indicates that DHCP_DDNS received a request to
update a the reverse DNS information for the given FQDN but for which there are
no configured DDNS domains in the DHCP_DDNS configuration.  Either the DHCP_DDNS
configuration needs to be updated or the source of the FQDN itself should be
investigated.

This is a debug message issued when the Dhcp-Ddns application enters
its init method.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_QUEUE_FULL application request queue has reached maximum number of entries %1
This an error message indicating that DHCP-DDNS is receiving DNS update
requests faster than they can be processed.  This may mean the maximum queue
needs to be increased, the DHCP-DDNS clients are simply generating too many
requests too quickly, or perhaps upstream DNS servers are experiencing
load issues.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RECONFIGURING application is reconfiguring the queue manager
This is an informational message indicating that DHCP_DDNS is reconfiguring the
queue manager as part of normal startup or in response to a new configuration.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RECOVERING application is attempting to recover from a
queue manager IO error

restart the queue manager after it suffered an IO error while receiving
requests.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RECV_ERROR application's queue manager was notified of a request receive error by its listener.
This is an error message indicating that the NameChangeRequest listener used by
DHCP-DDNS to receive requests encountered a IO error.  There should be
corresponding log messages from the listener layer with more details. This may
indicate a network connectivity or system resource issue.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RESUME_ERROR application could not restart the queue manager, reason: %1
This is an error message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager could not
be restarted after stopping due to an a full receive queue.  This means that
the application cannot receive requests. This is most likely due to DHCP_DDNS
configuration parameters referring to resources such as an IP address or port,
that is no longer unavailable.  DHCP_DDNS will attempt to restart the queue
manager if given a new configuration.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RESUMING application is resuming listening for requests now that the request queue size has reached %1 of a maximum %2 allowed
This is an informational message indicating that DHCP_DDNS, which had stopped
accepting new requests, has processed enough entries from the receive queue to
resume accepting requests.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_STARTED application's queue manager has begun listening for requests.
This is a debug message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager has
successfully started and is now listening for NameChangeRequests.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_START_ERROR application could not start the queue manager, reason: %1
This is an error message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager could not
be started.  This means that the application cannot receive requests. This is
most likely due to DHCP_DDNS configuration parameters referring to resources
such as an IP address or port, that are unavailable.  DHCP_DDNS will attempt to
restart the queue manager if given a new configuration.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_STOPPED application's queue manager has stopped listening for requests.
This is an informational message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager has
stopped listening for NameChangeRequests.  This may be because of normal event
such as reconfiguration or as a result of an error.  There should be log
messages preceding this one to indicate why it has stopped.

This is an informational message indicating that DHCP_DDNS is stopping the
queue manager either to reconfigure it or as part of application shutdown.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_STOP_ERROR application encountered an error stopping the queue manager: %1
This is an error message indicating that DHCP_DDNS encountered an error while
trying to stop the queue manager.  This error is unlikely to occur or to
impair the application's ability to function but it should be reported for
analysis.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_UNEXPECTED_HANDLER_ERROR application's queue manager request receive handler experienced an unexpected exception %1:
This is an error message indicating that an unexpected error occurred within the
DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager request receive completion handler. This is most
likely a programmatic issue that should be reported.  The application may
recover on its own.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_UNEXPECTED_STOP application's queue manager receive was
aborted unexpectedly while queue manager state is: %1
This is an error message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager request
receive was unexpected interrupted.  Normally, the read is receive is only
interrupted as a normal part of stopping the queue manager.  This is most
likely a programmatic issue that should be reported.

Differences of Bind 10 to other software
========================================

BIND 9
------

TODO: There are definitely more differences than just this.

* When an incoming zone transfer fails, for example because the
  received zone doesn't contain a NS record, bind 9 stops serving the
  zone and returns SERVFAIL to queries for that zone. Bind 10 still
  uses the previous version of zone.

RDATA implementations:
* IN/A: BIND 10 does not accept abbreviated forms of textual IPv4
  addresses for class-IN, type-A RDATA.  BIND 9 warns about it but
  still accepts it as the standard inet_aton() function.  Such forms
  should actually be NOT accepted per RFC 1035, but BIND 9 accepts them
  probably because of compatibility reasons.  Until our strict
  (and more correct) behavior causes operations issues, we'll keep it.

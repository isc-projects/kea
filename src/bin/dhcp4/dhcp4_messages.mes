% DHCP4_ACTIVATE_INTERFACE activating interface %1
This message is printed when DHCPv4 server enabled an interface to be used
to receive DHCPv4 traffic. IPv4 socket on this interface will be opened once
Interface Manager starts up procedure of opening sockets.

% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTED control channel session started on socket %1
A debug message issued during startup after the DHCPv4 server has
successfully established a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTING starting control channel session, specfile: %1
This debug message is issued just before the DHCPv4 server attempts
to establish a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_CLASS_ASSIGNED client packet has been assigned to the following class(es): %1
This debug message informs that incoming packet has been assigned to specified
class or classes. This is a norma

% DHCP4_CLASS_PROCESSING_FAILED client class specific processing failed
This debug message means that the server processing that is unique for each
client class has reported a failure. The response packet will not be sent.

% DHCP4_CLIENT_NAME_PROC_FAIL failed to process the fqdn or hostname sent by a client: %1
This debug message is issued when the DHCP server was unable to process the
FQDN or Hostname option sent by a client. This is likely because the client's
name was malformed or due to internal server error.

% DHCP4_COMMAND_RECEIVED received command %1, arguments: %2
A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND 10 control system by the DHCPv4 server.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_RECEIVED received configuration %1
A debug message listing the configuration received by the DHCPv4 server.
The source of that configuration depends on used configuration backend.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_COMPLETE DHCPv4 server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. It is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL failed to load configuration: %1
This critical error message indicates that the initial DHCPv4
configuration has failed. The server will start, but nothing will be
served until the configuration has been corrected.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_NEW_SUBNET a new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified IPv4 subnet.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_OPTION_DUPLICATE multiple options with the code %1 added to the subnet %2
This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options
with the same option code for a particular subnet. Adding multiple options
is uncommon for DHCPv4, but is not prohibited.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_START DHCPv4 server is processing the following configuration: %1
This is a debug message that is issued every time the server receives a
configuration. That happens at start up and also when a server configuration
change is committed by the administrator.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_UPDATE updated configuration received: %1
A debug message indicating that the DHCPv4 server has received an
updated configuration from the BIND 10 configuration system.

% DHCP4_DDNS_REQUEST_SEND_FAILED failed sending a request to kea-dhcp-ddns, error: %1,  ncr: %2
This error message indicates that DHCP4 server attempted to send a DDNS
update reqeust to the DHCP-DDNS server.  This is most likely a configuration or
networking error.

% DHCP4_DEACTIVATE_INTERFACE deactivate interface %1
This message is printed when DHCPv4 server disables an interface from being
used to receive DHCPv4 traffic. Sockets on this interface will not be opened
by the Interface Manager until interface is enabled.

% DHCP4_DHCID_COMPUTE_ERROR failed to compute the DHCID for lease: %1, reason: %2
This error message is logged when the attempt to compute DHCID for a specified
lease has failed. The lease details and reason for failure is logged in the
message.

% DHCP4_DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION initate server reconfiguration using file: %1, after receiving SIGHUP signal
This is the info message logged when the DHCPv4 server starts reconfiguration
as a result of receiving SIGHUP signal.

% DHCP4_DYNAMIC_RECONFIGURATION_FAIL dynamic server reconfiguration failed with file: %1
This is an error message logged when the dynamic reconfiguration of the
DHCP server failed.

% DHCP4_EMPTY_HOSTNAME received empty hostname from the client, skipping processing of this option
This debug message is issued when the server received an empty Hostname option
from a client. Server does not process empty Hostname options and therefore
option is skipped.

% DHCP4_HOOKS_LIBS_RELOAD_FAIL reload of hooks libraries failed
A "libreload" command was issued to reload the hooks libraries but for
some reason the reload failed.  Other error messages issued from the
hooks framework will indicate the nature of the problem.

% DHCP4_HOOK_BUFFER_RCVD_SKIP received DHCPv4 buffer was dropped because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on buffer4_receive
hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the
setting of the flag by a callout instructs the server to drop the packet.

% DHCP4_HOOK_BUFFER_SEND_SKIP prepared DHCPv4 response was dropped because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on buffer4_send
hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the
setting of the flag by a callout instructs the server to drop the packet.
Server completed all the processing (e.g. may have assigned, updated
or released leases), but the response will not be send to the client.

% DHCP4_HOOK_LEASE4_RELEASE_SKIP DHCPv4 lease was not released because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_release
hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the
setting of the flag by a callout instructs the server to not release
a lease.

% DHCP4_HOOK_PACKET_RCVD_SKIP received DHCPv4 packet was dropped, because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on the pkt4_receive
hook point sets the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the
setting of the flag instructs the server to drop the packet.

% DHCP4_HOOK_PACKET_SEND_SKIP prepared DHCPv6 response was not sent, because a callout set skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on the pkt4_send
hook point sets the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the setting
of the flag instructs the server to drop the packet. This means that
the client will not get any response, even though the server processed
client's request and acted on it (e.g. possibly allocated a lease).

% DHCP4_HOOK_SUBNET4_SELECT_SKIP no subnet was selected, because a callout set skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on the
subnet4_select hook point sets the skip flag. For this particular hook
point, the setting of the flag instructs the server not to choose a
subnet, an action that severely limits further processing; the server
will be only able to offer global options - no addresses will be assigned.

% DHCP4_INVALID_ADDRESS_INIT_REBOOT client having client-id %1, hwaddr %2 and being in the INIT-REBOOT state requested invalid address %3
This debug message is issued when the client being in the INIT-REBOOT state
requested an address which is not assigned to him. The server will respond
to this client with DHCPNAK.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT lease %1 advertised (client client-id %2, hwaddr %3)
This debug message indicates that the server successfully advertised
a lease. It is up to the client to choose one server out of othe advertised
and continue allocation with that server. This is a normal behavior and
indicates successful operation.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT_FAIL failed to advertise a lease for client client-id %1, hwaddr %2, client sent yiaddr %3
This message indicates that the server has failed to offer a lease to
the specified client after receiving a DISCOVER message from it. There are
many possible reasons for such a failure.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC lease %1 has been allocated for client-id %2, hwaddr %3
This debug message indicates that the server successfully granted a lease
in response to client's REQUEST message. This is a normal behavior and
indicates successful operation.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC_FAIL failed to grant a lease for client-id %1, hwaddr %2, client sent yiaddr %3
This message indicates that the server failed to grant a lease to the
specified client after receiving a REQUEST message from it.  There are many
possible reasons for such a failure. Additional messages will indicate the
reason.

% DHCP4_NAME_GEN_UPDATE_FAIL failed to update the lease after generating name for a client: %1
This message indicates the failure when trying to update the lease and/or
options in the server's response with the hostname generated by the server
from the acquired address. The message argument indicates the reason for the
failure.

% DHCP4_NCR_CREATION_FAILED failed to generate name change requests for DNS: %1
This message indicates that server was unable to generate NameChangeRequests
which should be sent to the kea-dhcp_ddns module to create
new DNS records for the lease being acquired or to update existing records
for the renewed lease. The reason for the failure is printed in the logged
message.

% DHCP4_NOT_RUNNING DHCPv4 server is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
DHCPv4 server but it is not running.

% DHCP4_NO_SOCKETS_OPEN no interface configured to listen to DHCP traffic
This warning message is issued when current server configuration specifies
no interfaces that server should listen on, or specified interfaces are not
configured to receive the traffic.

% DHCP4_NO_SUBNET_FOR_DIRECT_CLIENT no suitable subnet configured for a direct client sending packet with transaction id %1, on interface %2, received message is dropped
This info messsage is logged when received a message from a directly connected
client but there is no suitable subnet configured for the interface on
which this message has been received. The IPv4 address assigned on this
interface must belong to one of the configured subnets. Otherwise
received message is dropped.

% DHCP4_OPEN_SOCKET opening sockets on port %1
A debug message issued during startup, this indicates that the DHCPv4
server is about to open sockets on the specified port.

% DHCP4_OPEN_SOCKET_FAIL failed to create socket: %1
A warning message issued when IfaceMgr fails to open and bind a socket. The reason
for the failure is appended as an argument of the log message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_DROP_NO_TYPE packet received on interface %1 dropped, because of missing msg-type option
This is a debug message informing that incoming DHCPv4 packet did not
have mandatory DHCP message type option and thus was dropped.

% DHCP4_PACKET_NOT_FOR_US received DHCPv4 message (transid=%1, iface=%2) dropped because it contains foreign server identifier
This debug message is issued when received DHCPv4 message is dropped because
it is addressed to a different server, i.e. a server identifier held by
this message doesn't match the identifier used by our server. The arguments
of this message hold the name of the transaction id and interface on which
the message has been received.

% DHCP4_PACKET_PARSE_FAIL failed to parse incoming packet: %1
The DHCPv4 server has received a packet that it is unable to
interpret. The reason why the packet is invalid is included in the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_PROCESS_FAIL failed to process packet received from %1: %2
This is a general catch-all message indicating that the processing of a
received packet failed.  The reason is given in the message.  The server
will not send a response but will instead ignore the packet.

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVED %1 (type %2) packet received on interface %3
A debug message noting that the server has received the specified type of
packet on the specified interface.  Note that a packet marked as UNKNOWN
may well be a valid DHCP packet, just a type not expected by the server
(e.g. it will report a received OFFER packet as UNKNOWN).

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVE_FAIL error on attempt to receive packet: %1
The DHCPv4 server tried to receive a packet but an error
occurred during this attempt. The reason for the error is included in
the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_SEND_FAIL failed to send DHCPv4 packet: %1
This error is output if the DHCPv4 server fails to send an assembled
DHCP message to a client. The reason for the error is included in the
message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_EXCEPTION parser failed to commit changes
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the DHCPv4
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but one
of them failed to commit its changes due to a low-level system exception
being raised.  Additional messages may be output indicating the reason.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_FAIL parser failed to commit changes: %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the DHCPv4
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but
one of them failed to commit its changes.  The reason for the failure
is given in the message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATED created parser for configuration element %1
A debug message output during a configuration update of the DHCPv4
server, notifying that the parser for the specified configuration element
has been successfully created.

% DHCP4_PARSER_EXCEPTION failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the DHCPv4 server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of
the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the parsing
actions and committal of changes failed.  The message has been output in
response to a non-BIND 10 exception being raised.  Additional messages
may give further information.

% DHCP4_PARSER_FAIL failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the DHCPv4 server failed to create a parser to decode the contents
of the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the
parsing actions and committal of changes failed.  The reason for the
failure is given in the message.

% DHCP4_QUERY_DATA received packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data received from the client.

% DHCP4_QUEUE_NCR name change request to %1 DNS entry queued: %2
A debug message which is logged when the NameChangeRequest to add or remove
a DNS entries for a particular lease has been queued. The first parameter of
this log message indicates whether the DNS entry is to be added or removed.
The second parameter carries the details of the NameChangeRequest.

% DHCP4_RELEASE address %1 belonging to client-id %2, hwaddr %3 was released properly.
This debug message indicates that an address was released properly. It
is a normal operation during client shutdown.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_EXCEPTION exception %1 while trying to release address %2
This message is output when an error was encountered during an attempt
to process a RELEASE message. The error will not affect the client,
which does not expect any response from the server for RELEASE
messages. Depending on the nature of problem, it may affect future
server operation.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL failed to remove lease for address %1 for duid %2, hwaddr %3
This error message indicates that the software failed to remove a
lease from the lease database. It is probably due to an error during a
database operation: resolution will most likely require administrator
intervention (e.g. check if DHCP process has sufficient privileges to
update the database). It may also be triggered if a lease was manually
removed from the database during RELEASE message processing.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_NO_LEASE client (client-id %1, hwaddr %2) tried to release address, %3, but there is no such lease.
This warning message is printed when client attempts to release a lease,
but no such lease is known to the server.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_CLIENT_ID client (client-id %2) tried to release address %1, but it belongs to client (client-id %3)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that belongs to a different client. This should not happen in normal
circumstances and may indicate a misconfiguration of the client.  However,
since the client releasing the address will stop using it anyway, there
is a good chance that the situation will correct itself.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_HWADDR client (client-id %2) tried to release address %1, but sent from a wrong hardware address (%3)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that does belong to it, but the lease information was associated with
a different hardware address. One possible reason for using different
hardware address is that a cloned virtual machine was not updated and
both clones use the same client-id.

% DHCP4_RESPONSE_DATA responding with packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data returned to the client.

% DHCP4_SERVER_FAILED server failed: %1
The DHCPv4 server has encountered a fatal error and is terminating.
The reason for the failure is included in the message.

% DHCP4_INIT_FAIL failed to initialize Kea server: %1
The server has failed to initialize. This may be because the configuration
was not successful, or it encountered any other critical error on startup.
Attached error message provides more details about the issue.

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN server shutdown
The DHCPv4 server has terminated normally.

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST shutdown of server requested
This debug message indicates that a shutdown of the DHCPv4 server has
been requested via a call to the 'shutdown' method of the core Dhcpv4Srv
object.

% DHCP4_SRV_CONSTRUCT_ERROR error creating Dhcpv4Srv object, reason: %1
This error message indicates that during startup, the construction of a
core component within the DHCPv4 server (the Dhcpv4 server object)
has failed.  As a result, the server will exit.  The reason for the
failure is given within the message.

% DHCP4_STARTING server starting
This informational message indicates that the DHCPv4 server has
processed any command-line switches and is starting.

% DHCP4_START_INFO pid: %1, port: %2, verbose: %3
This is a debug message issued during the DHCPv4 server startup.
It lists some information about the parameters with which the server
is running.

% DHCP4_SUBNET_SELECTED the %1 subnet was selected for client assignment
This is a debug message noting the selection of a subnet to be used for
address and option assignment.  Subnet selection is one of the early
steps in the processing of incoming client message.

% DHCP4_SUBNET_SELECTION_FAILED failed to select a subnet for incoming packet, src: %1, type: %2
This warning message is output when a packet was received from a subnet
for which the DHCPv4 server has not been configured. The most probable
cause is a misconfiguration of the server.

% DHCP4_UNRECOGNIZED_RCVD_PACKET_TYPE received message (transaction id %1) has unrecognized type %2 in option 53
This debug message indicates that the message type carried in DHCPv4 option
53 is unrecognized by the server. The valid message types are listed
on the IANA website: http://www.iana.org/assignments/bootp-dhcp-parameters/bootp-dhcp-parameters.xhtml#message-type-53.
The message will not be processed by the server.

% DHCP4_UNSUPPORTED_RCVD_PACKET_TYPE received message (transaction id %1), having type %2 is not supported
This debug message indicates that the message type carried in DHCPv4 option
53 is valid but the message will not be processed by the server. This includes
messages being normally sent by the server to the client, such as Offer, ACK,
NAK etc.

# No namespace declaration - these constants go in the global namespace

# since these messages are for the python server_common library, care must
# be taken that names do not conflict with the messages from the c++

# have that at this moment. So when adding a message, make sure that
# the name is not already used in src/lib/config/config_messages.mes

% PYSERVER_COMMON_TSIG_KEYRING_DEINIT Deinitializing global TSIG keyring
A debug message noting that the global TSIG keyring is being removed from
memory. Most programs don't do that, they just exit, which is OK.

% PYSERVER_COMMON_TSIG_KEYRING_INIT Initializing global TSIG keyring
A debug message noting the TSIG keyring storage is being prepared. It should
appear at most once in the lifetime of a program. The keyring still needs
to be loaded from configuration.

% PYSERVER_COMMON_TSIG_KEYRING_UPDATE Updating global TSIG keyring
A debug message. The TSIG keyring is being (re)loaded from configuration.
This happens at startup or when the configuration changes. The old keyring
is removed and new one created with all the keys.

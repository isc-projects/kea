class ZoneConfig:
    '''A temporary helper class to encapsulate zone related configuration.

    Its find_zone method will search the conceptual configuration for a
    given zone, and return a tuple of zone type (primary or secondary) and
    the client object to access the data source stroing the zone.
    It's very likely that details of zone related configurations like this
    will change in near future, so the main purpose of this class is to
    provide an independent interface for the main DDNS session module
    until the details are fixed.

        '''Constructor.

        Parameters:
        - secondaries: a set of 2-element tuples.  Each element is a pair
          of isc.dns.Name and isc.dns.RRClass, and identifies a single
          secondary zone.
        - datasrc_class: isc.dns.RRClass object.  Specifies the RR class
          of datasrc_client.
        - datasrc_client: isc.dns.DataSourceClient object.  A data source
          class for the RR class of datasrc_class.  It's expected to contain
          a zone that is eventually updated in the ddns package.
        - acl_map: a dictionary that maps a tuple of
          (isc.dns.Name, isc.dns.RRClass) to an isc.dns.dns.RequestACL
          object.  It defines an ACL to be applied to the zone defined
          by the tuple.  If unspecified, or the map is empty, the default
          ACL will be applied to all zones, which is to reject any requests.

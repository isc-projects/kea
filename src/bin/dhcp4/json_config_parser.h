/// @brief Configure DHCPv4 server (@c Dhcpv4Srv) with a set of configuration
/// values.
///
/// This function parses configuration information stored in @c config_set
/// and configures the @c server by applying the configuration to it.
/// It provides the strong exception guarantee as long as the underlying
/// derived class implementations of @c DhcpConfigParser meet the assumption,
/// that is, it ensures that either configuration is fully applied or the
/// state of the server is intact.
///
/// If a syntax or semantics level error happens during the configuration
/// (such as malformed configuration or invalid configuration parameter),
/// this function returns appropriate error code.
///
/// This function is called every time a new configuration is received. The
/// extra parameter is a reference to DHCPv4 server component. It is currently
/// not used and CfgMgr::instance() is accessed instead.
///
/// Test-only mode added. If check_only flag is set to true, the configuration
/// is parsed, but the actual change is not applied. The goal is to have
/// the ability to test configuration.
///
/// This method does not throw. It catches all exceptions and returns them as
/// reconfiguration statuses. It may return the following response codes:
/// 0 - configuration successful
/// 1 - malformed configuration (parsing failed)
/// 2 - commit failed (parsing was successful, but failed to store the
/// values in to server's configuration)
///
/// @param config_set a new configuration (JSON) for DHCPv4 server
/// @param check_only whether this configuration is for testing only
/// @return answer that contains result of reconfiguration

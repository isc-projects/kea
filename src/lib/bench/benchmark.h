/// \brief Templated micro benchmark framework.
///
/// "Premature optimization is the root of all evil."
/// But programmers are often tempted to focus on performance optimization
/// too early.
/// Likewise, it's not uncommon for an engineer to introduce a minor
/// optimization with a lot of complicated code logic that actually improves
/// performance only marginally.
/// Making benchmark easier will help avoid such common pitfalls.
/// Of course, it also helps when we really need to introduce optimization
/// to identify where is the bottleneck and see how a particular optimization
/// improves the performance.
///
/// The BenchMark class template provides a simple framework for so-called
/// "stopwatch" micro benchmarking.
/// It just encapsulates the common operations for this type of benchmark:
/// repeat a specified operation for a given number of times,
/// record the start and end times of the operations,
/// and provide major accumulated results such as the number of iterations
/// per second.
/// The main goal of this class is to help developers write benchmark test
/// cases with fewer strokes of typing.
///
/// The constructors of a \c BenchMark class is to take the number of
/// iterations (which is referred to as \c niter below)
/// and an object (or reference to it) of the type of the template
/// parameter, \c T.  Class \c T implements the benchmark target code via
/// its \c run() method, whose signature is as follows:
/// \code  unsigned int T::run(); \endcode
///
/// A BenchMark class object, via its own \c run() method, calls \c T::run()
/// for \c niter times.
/// In the simplest form \c T::run() would perform a single operation to
/// be benchmarked and returns 1.
/// In some cases, however, the operation is very lightweight (e.g. performing
/// a binary search on a moderate length of integer vector), and it may be
/// desirable to have an internal iterations within \c T::run() to avoid
/// the overhead of function calls to \c T::run().
/// In that case, \c T::run() would return the number of internal iterations
/// instead of 1.
///
/// The \c BenchMark::run() method records some statistics %data on the
/// benchmarking, including the start and end times and the total number of
/// iterations (which is the sum of the return value of \c T::run(), and,
/// is equal to \c niter in the simplest case where \c T::run() always
/// returns 1).
/// This %data can be retried via other methods of \c BenchMark, but in
/// the primarily intended use case the \c BenchMark object would calls its
/// \c run() method at the end of its construction, and prints summarized
/// statistics to the standard output.
/// This way, the developer can only write a single line of code to perform
/// everything other than the benchmark target code (see the example below).
///
/// \b Example
///
/// Suppose that we want to measure performance of the search (find)
/// operation on STL set objects.  We'd first define the implementation
/// class (to be the template parameter of the \c BenchMark class) as follows:
///
/// \code class SetSearchBenchMark {
/// public:
///    SetSearchBenchMark(const set<int>& data, const vector<int>& keys) :
///        data_(data), keys_(keys)
///    {}
///    unsigned int run() {
///        vector<int>::const_iterator iter;
///        vector<int>::const_iterator end_key = keys_.end();
///        for (iter = keys_.begin(); iter != end_key; ++iter) {
///            data_.find(*iter);
///        }
///        return (keys_.size());
///    }
///    const set<int>& data_;
///    const vector<int>& keys_;
/// }; \endcode
///
/// In its constructor the \c SetSearchBenchMark class takes a set of
/// integers (\c %data) and a vector of integers (\c keys).  \c %data is
/// the STL set to be searched, and \c keys stores the search keys.
/// The constructor keeps local references to these objects.
///
/// The \c SetSearchBenchMark::run() method, which is called via
/// \c BenchMark::run(), iterates over the key vector, and performs the
/// \c find() method of the set class for each key.
/// (This is only for performance measurement, so the result is ignored).
/// Note that this \c run() method has its own internal iterations.
/// This is because each invocation of \c find() would be pretty lightweight,
/// and the function call overhead may be relatively heavier.
/// Due to the internal iterations, this method returns the number of
/// \c find() calls, which is equal to the size of the key vector.
///
/// Next, we should prepare test %data.  In this simple example, let's assume
/// we use a fixed size: a set of 10,000 integers (from 0 to 9999), and use
/// the same number of search keys randomly chosen from that range:
/// \code
///    set<int> data_set;
///    vector<int> keys;
///    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {
///        data_set.insert(i);
///        keys.push_back(rand() % 10000);
///    } \endcode
///
/// Then construct a \c BenchMark<SetSearchBenchMark> object with the
/// test %data:
/// \code
///    BenchMark<SetSearchBenchMark>(100, SetSearchBenchMark(data_set, keys));
/// \endcode
/// Here we specify 100 for the number of iterations, which would cause
/// 1 million search attempts in total.
///
/// That's it.  If we put these in a C++ source file with usual necessary
/// stuff (such as \c %main()), compile it, and run the executable, then
/// we'll see something like this:
///
/// \code Performed 1000000 iterations in 0.180172s (5550251.98ips) \endcode
///
/// It should be obvious what this means (ips stands for "iterations
///  per second").
///
/// A complete example program of this measurement scenario (with some
/// additional test cases and configurable parameters) can be found in
/// example/search_bench.cc.
///
/// \b Customization
///
/// The above simple usage should be sufficient in many benchmark cases,
/// but the \c BenchMark class provides some customization points by
/// specializing some of its (templated) public methods.
/// For example, assume you want to customize the output of benchmark result.
/// It can be done by specializing \c BenchMark::printResult():
/// \code namespace isc {
/// namespace bench {
/// template<>
/// void
/// BenchMark<SetSearchBenchMark>::printResult() const {
///     cout << "Searched for " << target_.keys_.size() << " keys "
///         << getIteration() << " times in " << getDuration() << "s" << endl;
/// }
/// }
/// } \endcode
///
/// Then the Result would be something like this:
///
/// \code Searched for 10000 keys 1000000 times in 0.21s \endcode
///
/// Note that the specialization must be defined in the same namespace as
/// that of the \c BenchMark class, that is, \c isc::bench.
/// It should also be noted that the corresponding \c SetSearchBenchMark
/// object can be accessed (through its public interfaces) via the \c target_
/// member variable of \c BenchMark.
///
/// <b>Future Plans and Compatibility Notes</b>
///
/// Currently, benchmark developers need to write supplemental code that is
/// not directly related to benchmarks (such as \c %main()) by hand.
/// It would be better if we could minimize such development overhead.
/// In future versions we may provide a common \c %main() function and
/// option parsers, thereby allowing the developer to only write the benchmark
/// classes and invoke them, just like what various unit test frameworks do.
///
/// If and when we implement it, some existing benchmark cases may need to be
/// adjusted.

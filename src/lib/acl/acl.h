 * whenever the action matches. They are tested in the order and first
 * match counts.
 *
 * This is non-copyable. It seems that there's no need to copy them (even
 * when it would be technically possible), so we forbid it just to prevent
 * copying it by accident. If there really is legitimate use, this restriction
 * can be removed.
 *
 * The class is template. It is possible to specify on which context the checks
 * match and which actions it returns. The actions must be copyable
 * for this to work and it is expected to be something small, usually an enum
 * (but other objects are also possible).
 *
 * \note There are protected functions. In fact, you should consider them
 *     private, they are protected so tests can get inside. This class
 *     is not expected to be subclassed in real applications.

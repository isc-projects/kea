    An instance of this class corresponds to the memory segment used
    for in-memory cache of a specific single data source.  It manages
    information to set/reset the latest effective segment (such as
    path to a memory mapped file) and sets of other modules using the
    segment.

    the top level class provides abstract interfaces independent from

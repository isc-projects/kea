The files in this directory implement a helper sub-library of the
inter process locking for the log library.  We use our own locks
because such locks are only available in relatively recent versions of
log4cplus.  Also (against our usual practice) we somehow re-invented
an in-house version of such a general purpose library rather than
existing proven tools such as boost::interprocess.  While we decided
to go with the in-house version for the log library at least until we
completely switch to log4cplus's native lock support, no other BIND 10
module should use this; they should use existing external
tools/libraries.

This sub-library is therefore "hidden" here.  As such, none of these
files should be installed.

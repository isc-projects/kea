% CONFIG_CCSESSION_MSG error in CC session message: %1
There was a problem with an incoming message on the command and control
channel. The message does not appear to be a valid command, and is
missing a required element or contains an unknown data format. This
most likely means that another BIND10 module is sending a bad message.
The message itself is ignored by this module.

% CONFIG_CCSESSION_MSG_INTERNAL error handling CC session message: %1
There was an internal problem handling an incoming message on the command
and control channel. An unexpected exception was thrown, details of
which are appended to the message. The module will continue to run,
but will not send back an answer.

The most likely cause of this error is a programming error.  Please raise
a bug report.

% CONFIG_GET_FAIL error getting configuration from cfgmgr: %1
The configuration manager returned an error when this module requested
the configuration. The full error message answer from the configuration
manager is appended to the log error. The most likely cause is that
the module is of a different (command specification) version than the
running configuration manager.

% CONFIG_JSON_PARSE JSON parse error in %1: %2
There was an error parsing the JSON file. The given file does not appear
to be in valid JSON format. Please verify that the filename is correct
and that the contents are valid JSON.

% CONFIG_MOD_SPEC_FORMAT module specification error in %1: %2
The given file does not appear to be a valid specification file: details
are included in the message. Please verify that the filename is correct
and that its contents are a valid BIND10 module specification.

% CONFIG_MOD_SPEC_REJECT module specification rejected by cfgmgr: %1
The specification file for this module was rejected by the configuration
manager. The full error message answer from the configuration manager is
appended to the log error. The most likely cause is that the module is of
a different (specification file) version than the running configuration
manager.

% CONFIG_OPEN_FAIL error opening %1: %2
There was an error opening the given file. The reason for the failure
is included in the message.

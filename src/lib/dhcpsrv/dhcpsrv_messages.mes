% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_IFACE listening on interface %1
An info message issued when a new interface is being added to the collection of
interfaces on which the server listens to DHCP messages.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_SUBNET4 adding subnet %1
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is adding the
specified IPv4 subnet to its database.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ADD_SUBNET6 adding subnet %1
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is adding the
specified IPv6 subnet to its database.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ALL_IFACES_ACTIVE enabling listening on all interfaces
A debug message issued when the server is being configured to listen on all
interfaces.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CFG_DHCP_DDNS Setting DHCP-DDNS configuration to: %1
A debug message issued when the server's DHCP-DDNS settings are changed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CLEAR_ACTIVE_IFACES stop listening on all interfaces
A debug message issued when configuration manager clears the internal list
of active interfaces. This doesn't prevent the server from listening to
the DHCP traffic through open sockets, but will rather be used by Interface
Manager to select active interfaces when sockets are re-opened.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CONFIG4_MERGED Configuration backend data has been merged.
This is an informational message emitted when the DHCPv4 server has
successfully merged configuration data retrieved from its configuration
backends into the current configuration.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CONFIG6_MERGED Configuration backend data has been merged.
This is an informational message emitted when the DHCPv6 server has
successfully merged configuration data retrieved from its configuration
backends into the current configuration.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_CONFIGURE_SERVERID server configuration includes specification of a server identifier
This warning message is issued when the server specified configuration of
a server identifier. If this new configuration overrides an existing
server identifier, this will affect existing bindings of the clients.
Clients will use old server identifier when they renew their bindings.
The server will not respond to those renews, and the clients will
eventually transition to rebinding state. The server should reassign
existing bindings and the clients will subsequently use new server
identifier. It is recommended to not modify the server identifier, unless
there is a good reason for it, to avoid increased number of renewals and
a need for rebinding (increase of multicast traffic, which may be received
by multiple servers).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DDNS_PARAMETER_IGNORED dhcp-ddns:%1 is deprecated, using existing global:%2
This is an informational message issued during configuration parsing when
the server detects that a deprecated parameter has been specified in the
"dhcp-ddns" element which conflicts with its corresponding global parameter.
When this occurs the server simply ignores the value from dhcp-ddns.
The log message shows be the deprecated and the supported parameter names.
Note the configuration change only affects the in-memory configuration.
Modify the configuration to comply with the supported parameters.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DDNS_PARAMETER_MOVED dhcp-ddns:%1 is deprecated, moving it to global:%2
This is an informational message issued during configuration parsing when
the server detects that a deprecated parameter has been specified in the
"dhcp-ddns" element for which no corresponding global value exists. When
this occurs, the server removes the parameter from dhcp-ddns and inserts the
parameter into the global scope. The log message shows the deprecated
and the supported parameter names. Note the configuration change only affects
the in-memory configuration. Modify the configuration to comply with
the supported parameters.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DEL_SUBNET4 IPv4 subnet %1 removed
This debug message is issued when a subnet is successfully removed from the
server configuration. The argument identifies the removed subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_DEL_SUBNET6 IPv6 subnet %1 removed
This debug message is issued when a subnet is successfully removed from the
server configuration. The argument identifies the removed subnet.

This informational message is issued when the server begins building a queue
of free address leases for the given subnet. It can take a considerable amount
of time, depending on the size of the address pools.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_FLQ_POPULATE_FREE_ADDRESS_LEASES_DONE populated %1 free address leases for the FLQ allocator in subnet %2 in %3
This informational message is issued when the server ends building a queue
of free address leases for a given subnet. The first argument logs the
number of free leases, the second argument logs the subnet, and the third
argument logs a duration.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_FLQ_POPULATE_FREE_PREFIX_LEASES populating free prefix leases for the FLQ allocator in subnet %1; it can take a while!
This informational message is issued when the server begins building a queue
of free leases for the given subnet. It can take a considerable amount of
time, depending on the size of the delegated prefix pools.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_FLQ_POPULATE_FREE_PREFIX_LEASES_DONE populated %1 free prefix leases for the FLQ allocator in subnet %2 completed in %3
This informational message is issued when the server ends building a queue
of free prefix leases for a given subnet. The first argument logs the
number of free leases, the second argument logs the subnet, and the third
argument logs a duration.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_IPV4_RESERVATIONS_NON_UNIQUE_IGNORED ignoring "ip-reservations-unique" setting because at least one of the host database backends does not support non-unique IP reservations in a subnet
This warning message is issued when the server failed to use the new setting
of the ip-reservations-unique global parameter configured via the configuration
backend. Some host database backends used apparently do not support specifying
several reservations for the same IP address in a subnet. The administrator
should either stop using the backend that does not support this setting or set
the value of the ip-reservations-unique to true to resolve the configuration
issue.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_IPV6_RESERVATIONS_NON_UNIQUE_IGNORED ignoring "ip-reservations-unique" setting because at least one of the host database backends does not support non unique IP reservations in a subnet
This warning message is issued when the server failed to use the new setting
of the ip-reservations-unique global parameter configured via the configuration
backend. Some host database backends used apparently do not support specifying
several reservations for the same IP address or delegated prefix in a subnet.
The administrator should either stop using the backend that does not support
this setting or set the value of the ip-reservations-unique to true to resolve
the configuration issue.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_IP_RESERVATIONS_UNIQUE_DUPLICATES_DETECTED the "ip-reservations-unique" flag is set to true and multiple reservations for the IP address %1 in subnet %2 are not allowed causing error: %3
This warning message is issued when the DHCP server is configured to not allow
multiple reservations for the same IP address. However, the host database
backend contains multiple reservations for the IP address logged as the first
argument, in the subnet logged as second argument, causing problems with lease
allocation logged as third argument.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_IP_RESERVATIONS_UNIQUE_DUPLICATES_POSSIBLE setting "ip-reservations-unique" from false to true poses a risk that some host backends may still contain multiple reservations for the same IP address
This warning message is issued when the DHCP server is configured to not allow
multiple reservations for the same IP address. However, the host database
backends may still contain multiple reservations for the same IP addresses
causing problems with lease allocation for certain addresses. Please ensure
that all such duplicates are removed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NEW_SUBNET4 a new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified IPv4 subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NEW_SUBNET6 a new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NO_SUBNET4 no suitable subnet is defined for address hint %1
This debug message is output when the DHCP configuration manager has received
a request for an IPv4 subnet for the specified address, but no such
subnet exists.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_NO_SUBNET6 no suitable subnet is defined for address hint %1
This debug message is output when the DHCP configuration manager has received
a request for an IPv6 subnet for the specified address, but no such
subnet exists.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ONLY_SUBNET4 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv4 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ONLY_SUBNET6 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv6 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_OPTION_DUPLICATE multiple options with the code: %1 added to the subnet: %2
This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options with the
same option code for the particular subnet. Adding multiple options is uncommon
for DHCPv6, but it is not prohibited.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_RENEW_GTR_REBIND in %1, the value of renew-timer %2 is greater than the value of rebind-timer %3, ignoring renew-timer
A warning message that indicates the configured renew-timer is greater
than the configured rebind-timer. The server will ignore the renew
timer value and send the rebind timer value only. This is considered
a non-fatal configuration error.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_RAW_UNSUPPORTED use of raw sockets is unsupported on this OS, UDP sockets will be used
This warning message is logged when the user specified that the
DHCPv4 server should use the raw sockets to receive the DHCP
messages and respond to the clients, but the use of raw sockets
is not supported on the particular environment. The raw sockets
are useful when the server must respond to the directly connected
clients which don't have an address yet. If the raw sockets are
not supported by Kea on the particular platform, Kea will fall
back to use of the IP/UDP sockets. The responses to
the directly connected clients will be broadcast. The responses
to relayed clients will be unicast as usual.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_TYPE_DEFAULT "dhcp-socket-type" not specified , using default socket type %1
This informational message is logged when the administrator hasn't
specified the "dhcp-socket-type" parameter in configuration for interfaces.
In such case, the default socket type will be used.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SOCKET_TYPE_SELECT using socket type %1
This informational message is logged when the DHCPv4 server selects the
socket type to be used for all sockets that will be opened on the
interfaces. Typically, the socket type is specified by the server
administrator. If the socket type hasn't been specified, the raw
socket will be selected. If the raw socket has been selected but
Kea doesn't support the use of raw sockets on the particular
OS, it will use an UDP socket instead.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET4 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv4 subnet when given the address hint specified
as the address is within the subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET4_ADDR selected subnet %1 for packet received by matching address %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv4 subnet for a received packet. This particular
subnet was selected, because an IPv4 address was matched which belonged to that
subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET4_IFACE selected subnet %1 for packet received over interface %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv4 subnet for a packet received over
the given interface. This particular subnet was selected, because it
was specified as being directly reachable over the given interface. (see
'interface' parameter in the subnet4 definition).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET4_RELAY selected subnet %1, because of matching relay addr %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv4 subnet, because detected relay agent address
matches value specified for this subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv6 subnet when given the address hint specified
as the address is within the subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6_IFACE selected subnet %1 for packet received over interface %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv6 subnet for a packet received over
given interface. This particular subnet was selected, because it
was specified as being directly reachable over given interface. (see
'interface' parameter in the subnet6 definition).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6_IFACE_ID selected subnet %1 (interface-id match) for incoming packet
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv6 subnet for a received packet. This particular
subnet was selected, because value of interface-id option matched what was
configured in the server's interface-id option for that selected subnet6.
(see 'interface-id' parameter in the subnet6 definition).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6_RELAY selected subnet %1, because of matching relay addr %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv6 subnet, because detected relay agent address
matches value specified for this subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_UNICAST_LINK_LOCAL specified link local address %1 for unicast traffic on interface %2
This warning message is logged when user specified a link-local address to
receive unicast traffic. The warning message is issued because it is an
uncommon use.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_UPDATE_SUBNET4 updating subnet %1 (result %2)
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is updating the
specified IPv4 subnet in its current configuration. Subnet ID and result
(expected to be true) are displayed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_UPDATE_SUBNET6 updating subnet %1 (result %2)
A debug message reported when the DHCP configuration manager is replacing the
specified IPv6 subnet in its current configuration. Subnet ID and result
(expected to be true) are displayed.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_USE_ADDRESS listening on address %1, on interface %2
A message issued when the server is configured to listen on the explicitly specified
IP address on the given interface.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_USE_ALLOCATOR using the %1 allocator for %2 leases in subnet %3

An info message issued when configuring the DHCP server to listen on the unicast
address on the specific interface.

% DHCPSRV_CLOSE_DB closing currently open %1 database
This is a debug message, issued when the DHCP server closes the currently
open lease database. It is issued at program shutdown and whenever
the database access parameters are changed: in the latter case, the
server closes the currently open database, and opens a database using
the new parameters.

% DHCPSRV_DDNS_TTL_PERCENT_TOO_SMALL ddns-ttl-percent %1 of lease lifetime %2 is too small, ignoring it
A debug message issued when the DDNS TTL value calculated using the
ddns-ttl-percent is zero.  Kea will ignore the value and calculate
the DDNS TTL as though ddsn-ttl-percent were not specified. The
value of ddns-ttl-percent and the lease lifetime are shown in
the message details.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP4O6_RECEIVED_BAD_PACKET received bad DHCPv4o6 packet: %1
A bad DHCPv4o6 packet was received.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_ERROR_EXCEPTION error handler for DHCP_DDNS IO generated an expected exception: %1
This is an error message that occurs when an attempt to send a request to
kea-dhcp-ddns fails there registered error handler threw an uncaught exception.
This is a programmatic error which should not occur. By convention, the error
handler should not propagate exceptions. Please report this error.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_HANDLER_NULL error handler for DHCP_DDNS IO is not set.
This is an error message that occurs when an attempt to send a request to
kea-dhcp-ddns fails and there is no registered error handler. This is a
programmatic error which should never occur and should be reported.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_NCR_REJECTED NameChangeRequest rejected by the sender: %1, ncr: %2
This is an error message indicating that NameChangeSender used to deliver DDNS
update requests to kea-dhcp-ddns rejected the request. This most likely cause
is the sender's queue has reached maximum capacity. This would imply that
requests are being generated faster than they can be delivered.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_NCR_SENT NameChangeRequest sent to kea-dhcp-ddns: %1
A debug message issued when a NameChangeRequest has been successfully sent to
kea-dhcp-ddns.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_SENDER_STARTED NameChangeRequest sender has been started: %1
An informational message issued when a communication with kea-dhcp-ddns has
been successfully started.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_SENDER_STOPPED NameChangeRequest sender has been stopped.
An informational message issued when a communication with kea-dhcp-ddns has
been stopped. This normally occurs during reconfiguration and as part of normal
shutdown. It may occur if kea-dhcp-ddns communications break down.

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_SUSPEND_UPDATES DHCP_DDNS updates are being suspended.
This is a warning message indicating the DHCP_DDNS updates have been turned
off. This should only occur if IO errors communicating with kea-dhcp-ddns
have been experienced. Any such errors should have preceding entries in the
log with details. No further attempts to communicate with kea-dhcp-ddns will
be made without intervention.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_RECOVER_SKIP DHCPv4 lease %1 was not recovered from the declined state because a callout set the skip status.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_recover
hook point set the next step status to SKIP. For this particular hook point, this
indicates that the server should not recover the lease from declined state.
The server will leave the lease as it is, in the declined state. The
server will attempt to recover it the next time decline recovery procedure
takes place.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_RENEW_SKIP DHCPv4 lease was not renewed because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_renew
hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the setting
of the flag by a callout instructs the server to not renew a lease. The
server will use existing lease as it is, without extending its lifetime.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_SELECT_SKIP Lease4 creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_select
hook point sets the skip flag. It means that the server was told that
no lease4 should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its
database and the client will get a NAK packet.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_EXTEND_SKIP DHCPv6 lease lifetime was not extended because a callout set the skip flag for message %1
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_renew
or the lease6_rebind hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook
point, the setting of the flag by a callout instructs the server to not
extend the lifetime for a lease. If the client requested renewal of multiple
leases (by sending multiple IA options), the server will skip the renewal
of the one in question and will proceed with other renewals as usual.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_RECOVER_SKIP DHCPv6 lease %1 was not recovered from declined state because a callout set the skip status.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_recover
hook point set the next step status to SKIP. For this particular hook point, this
indicates that the server should not recover the lease from declined state.
The server will leave the lease as it is, in the declined state. The
server will attempt to recover it the next time decline recovery procedure
takes place.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_SELECT_SKIP Lease6 (non-temporary) creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_select
hook point sets the skip flag. It means that the server was told that
no lease6 should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its
database and the client will get a NoAddrsAvail for that IA_NA option.

% DHCPSRV_HOST_MGR_DB_OPEN_CONNECTION_WITH_RETRY_FAILED Failed to connect to database: %1 with error: %2
This is an informational message issued when the server failed to connect to
the host database. The operation started a retry to connect procedure.
The database access string with password redacted is logged, along with the
error and details for the reconnect procedure.

% DHCPSRV_INVALID_ACCESS invalid database access string: %1
This is logged when an attempt has been made to parse a database access string
and the attempt ended in error. The access string in question - which
should be of the form 'keyword=value keyword=value...' is included in
the message.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE4_EXTENDED_INFO_SANITY_FAIL extended info for lease %1 failed checks (%2)
This error message is printed when a lease extended info failed to
pass sanity checks. The detail of the found problem was displayed and
the extended info deleted from the lease user context.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE4_EXTENDED_INFO_UPGRADED extended info for lease %1 was upgraded
This debug message is printed when a lease extended info was upgraded.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE6_EXTENDED_INFO_SANITY_FAIL extended info for lease %1 failed checks (%2)

pass sanity checks. The detail of the found problem was displayed and
the extended info deleted from the lease user context.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE6_EXTENDED_INFO_UPGRADED extended info for lease %1 was upgraded
This debug message is printed when a lease extended info was upgraded.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_MGR_CALLBACK_EXCEPTION exception occurred in a lease manager callback for callback type %1, subnet id %2, and lease %3: %4
This warning message is printed when one of the callback functions registered
in the lease manager causes an error. The callback functions can serve
different purposes and they likely log the detailed error messages. This
error message possibly indicates an unhandled error. The first argument
indicates a callback type. The second argument prints the subnet id.
The third argument prints the lease for which the error has occurred.
The last argument prints the error text.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_MGR_CALLBACK_UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION unknown exception occurred in a lease manager callback for callback type %1, subnet id %2, and lease %3
This warning message is printed when one of the callback functions registered
in the lease manager causes an unknown error. The callback functions can serve
different purposes and they likely log the detailed error messages. This
error message possibly indicates an unhandled error. The first argument
indicates a callback type. The second argument prints the subnet id.
The third argument prints the lease for which the error has occurred.
This log message variant contains no error text because it is triggered
by an unknown exception.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_MGR_DB_OPEN_CONNECTION_WITH_RETRY_FAILED Failed to connect to database: %1 with error: %2
This is an informational message issued when the server failed to connect to
the lease database. The operation started a retry to connect procedure.
The database access string with password redacted is logged, along with the
error and details for the reconnect procedure.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_SANITY_FAIL The lease %1 with subnet-id %2 failed subnet-id checks (%3).
This warning message is printed when the lease being loaded does not match the
configuration. Due to lease-checks value, the lease will be loaded, but
it will most likely be unused by Kea, as there is no subnet that matches
the IP address associated with the lease.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_SANITY_FAIL_DISCARD The lease %1 with subnet-id %2 failed subnet-id checks (%3) and was dropped.
This warning message is printed when a lease was loaded, but Kea was told
(by setting lease-checks parameter) to discard leases with inconsistent
data. The lease was discarded, because either there is no subnet configured
with matching subnet-id or the address of the lease does not belong to the
subnet.

% DHCPSRV_LEASE_SANITY_FIXED The lease %1 with subnet-id %2 failed subnet-id checks, but was corrected to subnet-id %3.
This informational message is printed when a lease was loaded, but had
incorrect subnet-id value. The lease-checks parameter was set to a value
that told Kea to try to correct the problem. There is a matching subnet,
so Kea updated subnet-id and loaded the lease successfully.

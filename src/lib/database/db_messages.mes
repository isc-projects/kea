% DATABASE_INVALID_ACCESS invalid database access string: %1
This is logged when an attempt has been made to parse a database access string
and the attempt ended in error.  The access string in question - which
should be of the form 'keyword=value keyword=value...' is included in
the message.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_COMMIT committing to MySQL database
The code has issued a commit call.  All outstanding transactions will be
committed to the database.  Note that depending on the MySQL settings,
the committal may not include a write to disk.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_FATAL_ERROR Unrecoverable MySQL error occurred: %1 for <%2>, reason: %3 (error code: %4).
An error message indicating that communication with the MySQL database server
has been lost.  If automatic recovery has been enabled,  then the server will
attempt to recover connectivity.  If not, then the server will exit with a
non-zero exit code.  The cause of such an error is most likely a network issue
or the MySQL server has gone down.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_INITIALIZE_SCHEMA Initializing the MySQL schema with command: %1.
This is logged before running the kea-admin command to automatically initialize the schema from Kea
after getting the schema version initially failed. The full kea-admin command is shown.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_ROLLBACK rolling back MySQL database
The code has issued a rollback call.  All outstanding transaction will
be rolled back and not committed to the database.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_START_TRANSACTION starting new MySQL transaction
A debug message issued when a new MySQL transaction is being started.
This message is typically not issued when inserting data into a
single table because the server doesn't explicitly start
transactions in this case. This message is issued when data is
inserted into multiple tables with multiple INSERT statements
and there may be a need to rollback the whole transaction if
any of these INSERT statements fail.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_COMMIT committing to PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a commit call.  All outstanding transactions will be
committed to the database.  Note that depending on the PostgreSQL settings,
the committal may not include a write to disk.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_CREATE_SAVEPOINT creating a new PostgreSQL savepoint: %1
The code is issuing a call to create a savepoint within the current
transaction.  Database modifications made up to this point will be preserved
should a subsequent call to rollback to this savepoint occurs prior to the
transaction being committed.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_DEALLOC_ERROR An error occurred deallocating SQL statements while closing the PostgreSQL lease database: %1
This is an error message issued when a DHCP server (either V4 or V6) experienced
and error freeing database SQL resources as part of closing its connection to
the PostgreSQL database.  The connection is closed as part of normal server
shutdown.  This error is most likely a programmatic issue that is highly
unlikely to occur or negatively impact server operation.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_FATAL_ERROR Unrecoverable PostgreSQL error occurred: Statement: <%1>, reason: %2 (error code: %3).
An error message indicating that communication with the PostgreSQL database server
has been lost.  If automatic recovery has been enabled,  then the server will
attempt to recover the connectivity.  If not, then the server will exit with a
non-zero exit code.  The cause of such an error is most likely a network issue
or the PostgreSQL server has gone down.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_INITIALIZE_SCHEMA Initializing the PostgreSQL schema with command: %1.
This is logged before running the kea-admin command to automatically initialize the schema from Kea
after getting the schema version initially failed. The full kea-admin command is shown.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_ROLLBACK rolling back PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a rollback call.  All outstanding transaction will
be rolled back and not committed to the database.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_ROLLBACK_SAVEPOINT rolling back PostgreSQL database to savepoint: $1
The code is issuing a call to rollback to the given savepoint.  Any database
modifications that were made after the savepoint was created will be rolled back
and not committed to the database.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_START_TRANSACTION starting a new PostgreSQL transaction
A debug message issued when a new PostgreSQL transaction is being started.
This message is typically not issued when inserting data into a
single table because the server doesn't explicitly start
transactions in this case. This message is issued when data is
inserted into multiple tables with multiple INSERT statements
and there may be a need to rollback the whole transaction if
any of these INSERT statements fail.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_TCP_USER_TIMEOUT_UNSUPPORTED tcp_user_timeout is not supported in this PostgreSQL version
This warning message is issued when a user has configured the tcp_user_timeout
parameter in the connection to the PostgreSQL database but the installed database
does not support this parameter. It is supported by the PostgreSQL version 12 or later.
The parameter setting will be ignored.

% DATABASE_TO_JSON_BOOLEAN_ERROR Internal logic error: invalid boolean value found in database connection parameters: %1=%2
This error message is printed when conversion to JSON of the internal state is requested,
but the connection string contains a boolean parameter with invalid value. It is a programming
error. The software will continue operation, but the returned JSON data will be syntactically
valid, but incomplete. The culprit parameter will not be converted.

% DATABASE_TO_JSON_INTEGER_ERROR Internal logic error: invalid integer value found in database connection parameters: %1=%2
This error message is printed when conversion to JSON of the internal state is requested,
but the connection string contains the integer parameter with a wrong value. It is a programming
error. The software will continue operation, but the returned JSON data will be syntactically
valid, but incomplete. The culprit parameter will not be converted.

% DATABASE_TO_JSON_UNKNOWN_TYPE_ERROR Internal logic error: unknown element found in database connection parameters: %1=%2
This error message is printed when conversion to JSON of the internal state is requested,
but the connection string contains unrecognized parameter. It is a programming error.
The software will continue operation, but the returned JSON data will be syntactically
valid, but incomplete. The unknown parameter will not be converted.

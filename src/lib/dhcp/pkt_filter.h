/// This class represents low level method to send and receive DHCP packet.
/// Different methods, represented by classes derived from this class, use
/// different socket families and socket types. Also, various packet filtering
/// methods can be implemented by derived classes, e.g. Linux Packet
/// Filtering (LPF) or Berkeley Packet Filtering (BPF).
///
/// Low-level code operating on sockets may require special privileges to execute.
/// For example: opening raw socket or opening socket on low port number requires
/// root privileges. This makes it impossible or very hard to unit test the IfaceMgr.
/// In order to overcome this problem, it is recommended to create mock object derived
/// from this class that mimics the behavior of the real packet handling class making
/// IfaceMgr testable.

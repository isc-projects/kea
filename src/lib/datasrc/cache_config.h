/// \brief Configuration for in-memory cache of a data source.
///
/// This class understands and validates the configuration parameters for
/// \c DataSourceClient related to in-memory cache, and converts it to native,
/// type-safe objects for the convenience of the user of this class.
/// Specifically, it allows the user to get the underlying memory segment
/// type for the cache as a string and to iterate over zone names to be
/// cached in memory.
///
/// It also provides unified interface for getting \c memory::LoadAction
/// object that can be used for loading zones, regardless of the underlying
/// data source properties, i.e., whether it's special "MasterFiles" type
/// or other generic data sources.
///
/// This class is publicly defined so it can be tested directly, but
/// it's essentially private to the \c ConfigurableClientList class.
/// It's therefore defined in an "internal" namespace, and isn't expected
/// to be used by other classes or user applications.  Likewise, this file
/// is not expected to be installed with other publicly usable header files.
///
/// It's defined as noncopyable, simply because it's not expected to be
/// copied in the intended usage for \c ConfigurableClientList.  Prohibiting
/// copies will help avoid unexpected disruption due to accidental copy and
/// sharing internal resources as a result of that.

    /// - For the "MasterFiles" type
    ///   - datasrc_client_ must not be provided (must be null); throws
    ///     InvalidParameter otherwise.
    ///   - cache must be enabled: "cache-enable" configuration item exists
    ///     and is true, and allowed parameter is true, too; throws
    ///     CacheConfigError otherwise.
    ///   - "params" configuration item must be provided and of a map type,
    ///     and each map entry maps a string to another string; throws
    ///     data::TypeError otherwise.
    ///   - the key string of each map entry must be a valid textual
    ///     representation of a domain name.  Otherwise corresponding
    ///     exception from the dns::Name class will be thrown.
    /// - For other types
    ///   - datasrc_client_ must be provided (must not be null); throws
    ///     InvalidParameter otherwise.
    ///   - (Unless cache is disabled) "cache-zones" configuration item must
    ///     exist and must be a list of strings; throws data::TypeError
    ///     otherwise.
    ///   - Each string value of cache-zones entries must be a valid textual
    ///     representation of a domain name.  Otherwise corresponding
    ///     exception from the dns::Name class will be thrown.
    ///   - Names in the list must not have duplicates;
    ///     throws CacheConfigError otherwise.
    ///
    /// For other data source types than "MasterFiles", cache can be disabled.

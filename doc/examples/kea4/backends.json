# This is an example configuration file for the DHCPv4 server in Kea.
# It is a basic scenario with one IPv4 subnet configured. It demnstrates
# how to configure Kea to use various backends to store leases:
# - memfile
# - MySQL
# - PostgreSQL
# - CQL (Cassandra) backend

{ "Dhcp4":

{
# Kea is told to listen on ethX interface only.
  "interfaces-config": {
    "interfaces": [ "ethX" ]
  },

# We need to specify lease type. Exactly one lease-database section
# should be present. Make sure you uncomment only one.

# 1. memfile backend. Leases information will be stored in flat CSV file.
# This is the easiest backend to use as it does not require any extra
# dependencies or services running.
#  "lease-database": {
#      "type": "memfile"
#  },

# 2. MySQL backend. Leases will be stored in MySQL database. Make sure it
# is up, running and properly initialized. See kea-admin documentation
# for details on how to intialize the database. The only strictly required
# parameters are type and name. If other parameters are not specified,
# Kea will assume the database is avaiable on localhost, that user and
# password is not necessary to connect and that timeout is 5 seconds.
# Kea must be compiled with --with-dhcp-mysql option to use this backend.

#  },

# 3. PostgreSQL backend. Leases will be stored in PostgreSQL database. Make
# sure it is up, running and properly initialized. See kea-admin documentation
# for details on how to intialize the database. The only strictly required
# parameters are type and name. If other parameters are not specified,
# Kea will assume the database is avaiable on localhost, that user and
# password is not necessary to connect and that timeout is 5 seconds.
# Kea must be compiled with --with-dhcp-pgsql option to use this backend.
#  "lease-database": {
#      "type": "pgsql",
#      "name": "keatest",
#      "host": "localhost",
#      "user": "keatest",
#      "password": "secret1"
#  },

# 4. CQL (Cassandra) backend. Leases will be stored in Cassandra database. Make
# sure it is up, running and properly initialized. See kea-admin documentation
# for details on how to intialize the database. The only strictly required
# parameters are type, keyspace and contact_points. At least one contact point
# must be specified, but more than one is required for redundancy. Make sure
# you specify the contact points without spaces. Kea must be compiled with
# --with-cql option to use this backend.

#      "type": "cql",
#      "keyspace": "keatest",
#      "contact_points": "192.0.2.1,192.0.2.2,192.0.2.3"
#  },

# Addresses will be assigned with valid lifetimes being 4000. Client
# is told to start renewing after 1000 seconds. If the server does not respond
# after 2000 seconds since the lease was granted, client is supposed
# to start REBIND procedure (emergency renewal that allows switching
# to a different server).
  "valid-lifetime": 4000,

# Renew and rebind timers are commented out. This implies that options
# 58 and 59 will not be sent to the client. In this case it is up to
# the client to pick the timer values according to RFC2131. Uncomment the
# timers to send these options to the client.
#  "renew-timer": 1000,
#  "rebind-timer": 2000,

# The following list defines subnets. We have only one subnet
# here. We tell Kea that it is directly available over local interface.

# informational level (info, warn, error) will will be logged to stdout.

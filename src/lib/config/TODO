Open issues for lib/config:

* Error output currently goes to stdout, and we need to use
  decent logging for that.
* Add "expect failure" tests to the unit tests.
* This cpp version does not use recvmsg() with a sequence number to
  prevent other messages sneaking in before the answer it expects.
  (because lib/cc/session.cc|h does not support that yet).

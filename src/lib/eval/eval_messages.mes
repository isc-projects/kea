# For use with TokenAnd
% EVAL_DEBUG_AND Popping %1 and %2 pushing %3
This debug message indicates that two values are popped from
the value stack.  Then are then combined via logical and and
the result is pushed onto the value stack.

# For use with TokenConcat

% EVAL_DEBUG_CONCAT Popping %1 and %2 pushing %3
This debug message indicates that the two strings are being popped off
of the stack.  They are then concatenated and the resulting string is
pushed onto the stack.  The strings are displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenEqual
# Start with binary for the inputs for now, we may add text in the future.

% EVAL_DEBUG_EQUAL Popping %1 and %2 pushing result %3
This debug message indicates that the two strings are being popped off
of the value stack and the result of comparing them is being pushed onto
the value stack.  The strings are displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenHexString

% EVAL_DEBUG_HEXSTRING Pushing hex string %1
This debug message indicates that the given binary string is being pushed
onto the value stack.  The string is displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenIfElse

% EVAL_DEBUG_IFELSE_FALSE Popping %1 (false) and %2, leaving %3
This debug message indicates that the condition is false so
the iftrue branch value is removed and the ifelse branch value
is left on the value stack.

% EVAL_DEBUG_IFELSE_TRUE Popping %1 (true) and %2, leaving %3
This debug message indicates that the condition is true so
the ifelse branch value is removed and the iftrue branch value
is left on the value stack.

# For use with TokenIpAddress

% EVAL_DEBUG_IPADDRESS Pushing IPAddress %1
This debug message indicates that the given binary string is being pushed
onto the value stack.  This represents either an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
The string is displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenMember

% EVAL_DEBUG_MEMBER Checking membership of '%1', pushing result %2
This debug message indicates that the membership of the packet for
the client class was checked.

# For use with TokenNot

% EVAL_DEBUG_NOT Popping %1 pushing %2
This debug message indicates that the first value is popped from
the value stack, negated and then pushed onto the value stack.
The string is displayed in text.

# For use with TokenOption based classes.  These include TokenOption,
# TokenRelay4Option and TokenRelay6Option.

% EVAL_DEBUG_OPTION Pushing option %1 with value %2
This debug message indicates that the given string representing the
value of the requested option is being pushed onto the value stack.
The string may be the text or binary value of the string based on the
representation type requested (.text or .hex) or "true" or "false" if
the requested type is .exists.  The option code may be for either an
option or a sub-option as requested in the classification statement.

# For use with TokenOr

% EVAL_DEBUG_OR Popping %1 and %2 pushing %3
This debug message indicates that two values are popped from
the value stack.  Then are then combined via logical or and
the result is pushed onto the value stack. The string is displayed
in text.

# For use with TokenPkt

% EVAL_DEBUG_PKT Pushing PKT meta data %1 with value %2
This debug message indicates that the given binary string representing
the value of the requested meta data is being pushed onto the value stack.
The string is displayed in hex at the exception of interface name.

# For use with TokenPkt4

% EVAL_DEBUG_PKT4 Pushing PKT4 field %1 with value %2
This debug message indicates that the given binary string representing
the value of the requested field is being pushed onto the value stack.
The string is displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenPkt6

% EVAL_DEBUG_PKT6 Pushing PKT6 field %1 with value %2
This debug message indicates that the given binary string representing
the value of the requested field is being pushed onto the value stack.
The string is displayed in hex.

# For use with TokenRelay6Field

% EVAL_DEBUG_RELAY6 Pushing PKT6 relay field %1 nest %2 with value %3
This debug message indicates that the given binary string representing
the value of the requested fied is being pushed onto the value stack.
The string is displayed in hex.

% EVAL_DEBUG_RELAY6_RANGE Pushing PKT6 relay field %1 nest %2 with value %3
This debug message is generated if the nest field is out of range.  The
empty string will always be the value pushed onto the stack.

# For use with TokenString

% EVAL_DEBUG_STRING Pushing text string %1
This debug message indicates that the given text string is being pushed
onto the value stack.  The string is displayed in text.

# For use with TokenSubstring
# Start with binary for the strings for now, we may add text in the future.

% EVAL_DEBUG_SUBSTRING Popping length %1, start %2, string %3 pushing result %4
This debug message indicates that three values are being popped from
the value stack and a result is being pushed onto the value stack.  The
values being popped are the starting point and length of a substring to
extract from the given string.  The resulting string is pushed onto
the stack.  The strings are displayed in hex.

% EVAL_DEBUG_SUBSTRING_EMPTY Popping length %1, start %2, string %3 pushing result %4
This debug message indicates that the string popped from the stack was empty
and so the result will also be empty.  The start, length and string are
still popped from the stack and the result is still pushed.

% EVAL_DEBUG_SUBSTRING_RANGE Popping length %1, start %2, string %3 pushing result %4
This debug message indicates that the value of start is outside of the
string and an empty result will be pushed onto the stack.  The start,
length and string are still popped from the stack and the result is
still pushed.  The strings are displayed in hex.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_DATA Data %1 (out of %2 received) in vendor class found, pushing result '%3'
This debug message indicates that vendor class option was found and passed
enterprise-id checks and has sufficient number of data chunks. The total number
of chunks and value pushed are reported as debugging aid.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_DATA_NOT_FOUND Requested data index %1, but option with enterprise-id %2 has only %3 data tuple(s), pushing result '%4'
This debug message indicates that vendor class option was found and passed
enterprise-id checks, but does not have sufficient number of data chunks.
Note that the index starts at 0, so there has to be at least (index + 1)
data chunks.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_ENTERPRISE_ID Pushing enterprise-id %1 as result 0x%2
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated and vendor
class option was found and its enterprise-id is being reported.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_ENTERPRISE_ID_MISMATCH Was looking for %1, option had %2, pushing result '%3'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated
and vendor class option was found, but has different enterprise-id than specified
in the expression.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_EXISTS Option with enterprise-id %1 found, pushing result '%2'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated and vendor
class option was found.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_CLASS_NO_OPTION Option with code %1 missing, pushing result '%2'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated
and vendor class option was not found.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_ENTERPRISE_ID Pushing enterprise-id %1 as result 0x%2
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated and vendor
option was found and its enterprise-id is being reported.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_ENTERPRISE_ID_MISMATCH Was looking for %1, option had %2, pushing result '%3'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated
and vendor option was found, but has different enterprise-id than specified
in the expression.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_EXISTS Option with enterprise-id %1 found, pushing result '%2'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated and vendor
option was found.

% EVAL_DEBUG_VENDOR_NO_OPTION Option with code %1 missing, pushing result '%2'
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated
and vendor option was not found.

% EVAL_RESULT Expression %1 evaluated to %2
This debug message indicates that the expression has been evaluated
to said value. This message is mostly useful during debugging of the
client classification expressions.

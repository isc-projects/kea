 DHCP micro-benchmarks
-----------------------

This directory contains simplified prototypes for various DB back-ends
that are planned or considered as a backend engine for BIND10 DHCP.
Athough trivial now, they are expected to evolve into useful tools
that will allow users to measure performance in their specific environment.

Currently the following benchmarks are planned:
- in memory+flat file
- SQLite
- MySQL

As they require additional (sometimes heavy) dependencies, they are not
built by default. Actually, their build system completely separated.
It will be eventually merged with the main BIND10 makefile system, but
that is a low priority for now.


 MySQL backend
---------------

MySQL backend requires MySQL client development libraries. It uses
mysql_config tool (that works similar to pkg-config) to discover
required compilation and linking options. To install required packages
on Ubuntu, use the following command:

sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev

Running MySQL server is required. Make sure that you have your setup
configured so there is a user that is able to create databases.

Before running tests, you need to initialize your database. You can
use mysql-init.sql script for that purpose.

WARNING: It will drop existing Kea database. Do not run this on
your production server. Assuming your MySQL user is kea, you can
initialize your test database by:

mysql -u kea -p < mysql-init.sql

After that step, you are ready to run the test:

./mysql_ubench

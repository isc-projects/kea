/// \brief Implementation aspects of logging levels
///
/// This extends the log4cplus level set to allow 100 debug levels.
///
/// First some terminology, as the use of the term "level" gets confusing.  The
/// code and comments here use the term "level" in two contexts:
///
/// Logging level: The category of messages to log.  By default log4cplus
/// defines the following logging levels: OFF_LOG_LEVEL, FATAL_LOG_LEVEL,
/// ERROR_LOG_LEVEL, WARN_LOG_LEVEL, INFO_LOG_LEVEL, DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL,
/// TRACE_LOG_LEVEL, ALL_LOG_LEVEL (which here will be abbreviated OFF, FATAL
/// etc.).  Within the context of Kea, OFF, TRACE and ALL are not used
/// and the idea of DEBUG has been extended, as will be seen below.  In
/// Kea terms, this is known as "severity"; the "logging level" usage will
/// usually be used when talking about log4cplus aspects of the idea (as
/// log4cplus uses that terminology).
///
/// Debug level: This is a number that ranges from 0 to 99 and is used by the
/// application to control the detail of debug output.  A value of 0 gives the
/// highest-level debug output; a value of 99 gives the most verbose and most
/// detailed. Debug messages (or whatever debug level) are only ever output
/// when the logging level is set to DEBUG. (Note that the numbers 0 and 99
/// are not hard-coded - they are the constants MIN_DEBUG_LEVEL and
/// MAX_DEBUG_LEVEL.)
///
/// With log4cplus, the various logging levels have a numeric value associated
/// with them, such that FATAL > ERROR > WARNING etc.  This suggests that the
/// idea of debug levels can be incorporated into the existing logging level
/// scheme by assigning them appropriate numeric values, i.e.
///
/// WARNING > INFO > DEBUG > DEBUG - 1 > DEBUG - 2 > ... > DEBUG - 99
///
/// Setting a numeric level of DEBUG enables the basic messages; setting higher
/// debug levels (corresponding to lower numeric logging levels) will enable
/// progressively more messages.  The lowest debug level (0) is chosen such that
/// it corresponds to the default level of DEBUG.
///
/// This class comprises nothing more than static methods to aid the conversion
/// of logging levels between log4cplus and Kea, and to register those
/// levels with log4cplus.

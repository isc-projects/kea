/// \brief The base class to search a zone for RRsets
///
/// The \c ZoneFinder class is an abstract base class for representing
/// an object that performs DNS lookups in a specific zone accessible via
/// a data source.  In general, different types of data sources (in-memory,
/// database-based, etc) define their own derived classes of \c ZoneFinder,
/// implementing ways to retrieve the required data through the common
/// interfaces declared in the base class.  Each concrete \c ZoneFinder
/// object is therefore (conceptually) associated with a specific zone
/// of one specific data source instance.
///
/// The origin name and the RR class of the associated zone are available
/// via the \c getOrigin() and \c getClass() methods, respectively.
///
/// The most important method of this class is \c find(), which performs
/// the lookup for a given domain and type.  See the description of the
/// method for details.
///
/// \note It's not clear whether we should request that a zone finder form a
/// "transaction", that is, whether to ensure the finder is not susceptible
/// to changes made by someone else than the creator of the finder.  If we
/// don't request that, for example, two different lookup results for the
/// same name and type can be different if other threads or programs make
/// updates to the zone between the lookups.  We should revisit this point

    ///
    /// <b>DNSSEC considerations:</b>
    /// The result when DNSSEC data are required can be very complicated,

    /// processing with DNSSEC data, and if the search result code is
    /// either \c NXDOMAIN or \c NXRRRSET, and/or \c isWildcard() returns
    /// true, then the application will need to find additional NSEC or
    /// NSEC3 records for supplemental proofs.  This method helps the
    /// application for such post search processing.
    ///
    /// First, it tells the application whether the zone is signed with
    /// NSEC or NSEC3 via the \c isNSEC(3)Signed() method.  Any sanely signed
    /// zone should be signed with either (and only one) of these two types
    /// of RRs; however, the application should expect that the zone could
    /// be broken and these methods could both return false.  But this method
    /// should ensure that not both of these methods return true.
    ///
    /// In case it's signed with NSEC3, there is no further information
    /// returned from this method.
    ///
    /// In case it's signed with NSEC, this method will possibly return
    /// a related NSEC RRset in the \c rrset member of \c FindContext.
    /// What kind of NSEC is returned depends on the result code
    /// (\c NXDOMAIN or \c NXRRSET) and on whether it's a wildcard match:
    ///
    /// - In case of NXDOMAIN, the returned NSEC covers the queried domain
    ///   that proves that the query name does not exist in the zone.  Note
    ///   that this does not necessarily prove it doesn't even match a
    ///   wildcard (even if the result of NXDOMAIN can only happen when
    ///   there's no matching wildcard either).  It is caller's
    ///   responsibility to provide a proof that there is no matching
    ///   wildcard if that proof is necessary.
    /// - In case of NXRRSET, we need to consider the following cases
    ///   referring to Section 3.1.3 of RFC4035:
    ///
    /// -# (Normal) no data: there is a matching non-wildcard name with a
    ///    different RR type.  This is the "No Data" case of the RFC.
    /// -# (Normal) empty non terminal: there is no matching (exact or
    ///    wildcard) name, but there is a subdomain with an RR of the query
    ///    name.  This is one case of "Name Error" of the RFC.
    /// -# Wildcard empty non terminal: similar to 2a, but the empty name
    ///    is a wildcard, and matches the query name by wildcard expansion.
    ///    This is a special case of "Name Error" of the RFC.
    /// -# Wildcard no data: there is no exact match name, but there is a
    ///    wildcard name that matches the query name with a different type
    ///    of RR.  This is the "Wildcard No Data" case of the RFC.
    ///
    /// In case 1, \c find() returns NSEC of the matching name.
    ///
    /// In case 2, \c find() will return NSEC for the interval where the
    /// empty nonterminal lives. The end of the interval is the subdomain
    /// causing existence of the empty nonterminal (if there's
    /// sub.x.example.com, and no record in x.example.com, then
    /// x.example.com exists implicitly - is the empty nonterminal and
    /// sub.x.example.com is the subdomain causing it).  Note that this NSEC
    /// proves not only the existence of empty non terminal name but also
    /// the non existence of possibly matching wildcard name, because
    /// there can be no better wildcard match than the exact matching empty
    /// name.

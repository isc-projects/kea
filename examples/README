This is the top directory for sample programs that can be developed
using public Kea libraries outside of the Kea project.  It's
intended to be built with installed Kea header files and library
objects, so it's not a target of the main build tree, and does not
refer to any other part of the Kea source tree that contains
this directory.

On the top (sub) directory (where this README file is stored), we
provide a sample configure.ac and Makefile.am files for GNU automake
environments with helper autoconf macros to detect the availability and
location of Kea header files and library objects.

This directory is currently empty, but we expect to move example
code here soon.

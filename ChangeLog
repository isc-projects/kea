   6.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/bindctl: fixed a bug that it didn't accept IPv6 addresses as
	command arguments. (Trac #219, svn r2022)
   5.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/xfrin: fixed several small bugs with many additional unit
	tests.  Fixes include: IPv6 transport support, resource leak,
	and non IN class support. (Trac #185, svn r2000)
   4.   [bug]           each
	bin/auth: output now prepended with "[b10-auth]" (Trac #109, svn r1985)
   3.	[func]		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
        boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
        headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
        using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)
   2.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)
   1.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,
	and invalid parameters could cause integer overflow and make the
	library crash. (Trac #177, svn r1806)

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[doc] update to documentation.  This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix.  This is no different than a general bug fix
	except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause 
	security patch releases.

and will not start.

% STATHTTPD_CC_SESSION_ERROR error connecting to message bus: %1
The stats-httpd module was unable to connect to the BIND 10 command
and control bus. A likely problem is that the message bus daemon
(b10-msgq) is not running. The stats-httpd module will now shut down.

% STATHTTPD_CLOSING closing %1#%2
The stats-httpd daemon will stop listening for requests on the given
address and port number.

% STATHTTPD_CLOSING_CC_SESSION stopping cc session
Debug message indicating that the stats-httpd module is disconnecting
from the command and control bus.

% STATHTTPD_HANDLE_CONFIG reading configuration: %1
The stats-httpd daemon has received new configuration data and will now
process it. The (changed) data is printed.

% STATHTTPD_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND shutdown command received
A shutdown command was sent to the stats-httpd module, and it will

is an error condition that likely points to a module that is not
responding correctly to statistic requests.

% STATHTTPD_SERVER_INIT_ERROR HTTP server initialization error: %1

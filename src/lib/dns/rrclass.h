/// The \c RRClass class encapsulates DNS resource record classes.

/// This class manages the 16-bit integer class codes in quite a straightforward
/// way.  The only non trivial task is to handle textual representations of
/// RR classes, such as "IN", "CH", or "CLASS65534".
///
/// This class consults a helper \c RRParamRegistry class, which is a registry
/// of RR related parameters and has the singleton object.  This registry
/// provides a mapping between RR class codes and their "well-known" textual
/// representations.
/// Parameters of RR classes defined by DNS protocol standards are automatically
/// registered at initialization time and are ensured to be always available for
/// applications unless the application explicitly modifies the registry.
///
/// For convenience, this class defines constant class objects corresponding to
/// standard RR classes.  These are generally referred to as the form of
/// <code>RRClass::{class-text}()</code>.
/// For example, \c RRClass::IN() is an \c RRClass object corresponding to the
/// IN class (class code 1).
/// Note that these constants are used through a "proxy" function.
/// This is because they may be used to initialize another non-local (e.g.
/// global or namespace-scope) static object as follows:
///
/// \code
/// namespace foo {
/// const RRClass default_class = RRClass::IN();
/// } \endcode
///
/// In order to ensure that the constant RRClass object has been initialized
/// before the initialization for \c default_class, we need help from
/// the proxy function.
///
/// Note to developers: same note as \c RRType applies.

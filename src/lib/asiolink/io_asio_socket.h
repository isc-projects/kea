/// signature of the more basic IOSocket class.

/// derived class for testing purposes rather than providing factory methods

    /// call.  Unfortunately, the macros that set the state of the coroutine

    /// to be discarded before being returned to the user.)

    /// I/O - it may take a number of I/Os - each receiving any non-zero number
    /// of bytes - to read the entire message.
    ///
    /// So the IOFetch code has to loop until it determines that all the data
    /// has been read.  This is where this method comes in.  It has several
    /// functions:
    ///
    /// - It checks if the received data is complete.
    /// - If data is not complete, decides if the next set of data is to go into
    ///   the start of the staging buffer or at some offset into it.  (This
    ///   simplifies the case we could have in a TCP receive where the two-byte
    ///   count field is received in one-byte chunks: we put off interpreting
    ///   the count until we have all of it.  The alternative - copying the
    ///   data to the output buffer and interpreting the count from there -
    ///   would require moving the data in the output buffer by two bytes before
    ///   returning it to the caller.)
    /// - Copies data from the staging buffer into the output buffer.
    ///
    /// This functionality mainly applies to TCP receives.  For UDP, all the
    /// data is received in one I/O, so this just copies the data into the
    /// output buffer.

    ///        entered, and it will be updated by this method as required.

    ///        put the received data.  It should be set to zero before the first
    ///        call and may be updated by this method.

    ///        really the TCP count field and is set to that value when enough

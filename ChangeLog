	(Gitlab #2504)

2044.	[func]		tmark
	Modified indexes on the hosts table in the postgresql
	schema to improve performance on host reservation searches.
	Thanks to Paul Kutzer for suggesting these changes.
	(Gitlab #2452)

2043.	[func]		andrei
	The status-get command now shows the status of the sockets being
	opened to receive DHCP requests, and a list of errors for the
	sockets that were not successfully created.
	(Gitlab #2434)

2042.	[func]		razvan
	Added missing parameters to YANG modules, including TLS
	parameters for database connections.
	(Gitlab #2224)

2041.	[bug]		tmark
	HA now applies load balancing and scoping only to inbound
	client packet types that apply to client lease fulfillment,
	e.g. DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPV6_SOLICIT, DHCPV6_REQUEST,
	etc. Previously, HA indiscriminately balanced and
	scoped all inbound packets, including those related to lease
	query.
	(Gitlab #1781)

2040.	[func]		djt
	Added support for Alpine 3.16 in hammer.py.
	(Gitlab #2491)

	support for lease limits.
	(Gitlab #2481)

2038.	[func]		djt
	Added a new statistic to kea-dhcp4 that counts host
	reservation conflicts. They are now tracked at both
	the global and subnet levels, as v4-reservation-conflicts
	and subnet[id].v4-reservation-conflicts, respectively.
	(Gitlab #2419)

2037.	[bug]		razvan, marcin
	Fixed a crash in the HA+MT scenario caused by a race condition
	which occurred between resetting the CalloutHandle state and
	accessing the hook point parameters, from different threads,
	when unparking packets.
	(Gitlab #2473)

2036.	[build]		andrei
	Added a tool that checks whether there are any missing REST
	commands from the API Reference section of the ARM.
	See tools/check-for-missing-api-commands.sh.
	It has been integrated into the Gitlab CI and runs on every
	push.
	(Gitlab #2379)

2035.	[doc]		Daniel Bjors
	The Developer's Guide now correctly uses the Lease4CollectionPtr
	and Lease6CollectionPtr types. Thanks to Daniel Bjors for
	reporting this typo.
	(Gitlab #2447)

2034.	[func]		andrei
	The PostgreSQL schema has been changed to provide initial support
	for the lease-limiting feature, part of the limits hook library.
	(Gitlab #2445)

2033.	[func]		tmark
	Functionality needed to support the lease-limiting feature of
	of the limits hook library has been added to Memfile_LeaseMgr.
	(Gitlab #2436)

Kea 2.1.7 (development) released on June 29, 2022

2032.	[build]         razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.1.7
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2455)

2031.	[func]		fdupont
	Improved compatibility with OpenSSL 3.0.x, in particular
	recover system error messages.
	(Gitlab #1614)

2030.	[doc]		fdupont, tomek
	GSS-TSIG examples updated. The recommendation to not use
	client-keytab and credentials-cache at the same time added.
	(Gitlab #2247)

2029.	[bug]		fdupont
	The check of the subnet id in configuration is stricter:
	values outside the 0..4294967295 are rejected. Note that
	the value 0 means to leave Kea to assign itself the id.
	(Gitlab #2086)

2028.	[build]		orbea, fdupont
	Compatibility with LibreSSL 3.5.2 improved.
	(Github #121, Gitlab #2411)

2027.	[func]		fdupont
	The TLS is now supported with Multi-Threaded HA (HA+MT) scenario.
	Additional parameters (trust-anchor, cert-file, key-file,
	require-client-certs) are now supported in the HA configuration.
	(Gitlab #1706)

2026.	[func]		andrei
	The MySQL schema has been changed to provide initial support for
	the lease limiting feature, part of the limits hook library.
	(Gitlab #2438)

2025.	[bug]		tmark
	Added missing support for client-class user-context to
	both MySQL and PostgreSQL CB hook libraries.
	(Gitlab #2430)

2024.	[func]		djt
	The ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET log message format has been
	slightly modified, so that when it is emitted for a subnet that
	is not within a shared network, it emits "(none)" for the value
	of the shared network. The ARM documentation for this parameter
	has been updated to reflect that subnets within shared networks
	will in fact display which shared network the subnet belongs to.
	The ALLOC_ENGINE_V6_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET log message format has
	changed to be consistent with the format of
	ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET.
	(Gitlab #2395)

2023.	[bug]		tmark
	Corrected a MySQL CB issue that caused subnets to be
	updated without having audit entries created when the
	affiliated shared-network is deleted.  This can cause
	the subnets to be excluded from subsequent CB refresh
	cycles.
	(Gitlab #2299)

Kea 2.1.6 (development) released on May 25 2022

2022.	[func]		andrei, djt
	kea-admin lease-upload now calls the lease file cleanup (LFC)
	process to clean up entries with duplicate addresses in the input
	CSV file, to avoid a conflict error when inserting the leases in
	the database. kea-admin also no longer asks for input on
	non-interactive shells. A new -y|--yes flag has been added that
	enables automatic overwriting of any file that kea-admin writes
	to, when dumping or uploading leases.
	(Gitlab #2293)

2021.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.1.6
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2421)

2020.	[doc]		andrei
	The rate-limiting feature of the new limits hook library has been
	documented. It can apply a specified limit of a certain number of
	packets per time unit to a given client class or subnet.
	(Gitlab #562, #1650)

2019.	[func]		tmark
	A new built-in class, "SKIP_DDNS", was added, which can be used
	in conjunction with the ddns-tuning hook library to skip
	performing DDNS updates for a given client.
	(Gitlab #2354)

2018.	[func]		razvan
	The kea-dhcp4 server now supports portions of RFC 3396, allowing
	it to send and receive DHCP options longer than 255 bytes.
	(Gitlab #2227)

2017.	[bug]		marcin
	A bug in the allocation engine, which caused it to write an
	allocated lease under the wrong subnet ID within a shared
	network, has been corrected. This was occurring when multiple
	clients matched the same fixed address reservation. The first
	client is now assigned the fixed address, while a subsequent
	client is then given a dynamically allocated address from a
	different subnet in the shared network.
	(Gitlab #2409)

2016.	[doc]		fdupont
	Documentation for the role-based access control (RBAC)
	premium hook library was added to the ARM.
	(Gitlab #1263)

Kea 2.1.5 (development) released on Apr 27, 2022

2015.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed an issue in kea-dhcp6 that was causing the server
	not to update the FQDN option in outbound responses when
	the ddns-tuning hook lib calculates a new host name.
	(Gitlab #2392)

2014.	[bug]		tmark
	Correct an issue that was causing reconfigure to fail
	in kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 when using ddns-tuning hook
	library.
	(Gitlab #2390)

2013.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.5 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2385)

2012.	[doc]		andrei
	Documented whether it's OK or not to have overlapping pools,
	including PD pools in IPv6.
	(Gitlab #1842)

2011.	[func]		djt
	Added CTRL_AGENT_COMMAND_RECEIVED log line with command and
	source address to the kea-ctrl-agent for commands which
	are not forwarded on to another daemon. Added client
	remote-address to CTRL_AGENT_COMMAND_FORWARDED log message if
	it is available.
	(Gitlab #687)

2010.	[func]		razvan
	Several extra log messages now detail the subnet selection
	process. The messages are available on debuglevel 40.
	(Gitlab #2352)

2009.	[func]		tmark
	Added new hook callout points: ddns4_update to Kea DHCPv4
	server and ddns6_update to Kea DHCPv6 server. This enables
	use of the ddns-tuning hook library.
	(Gitlab #1548)

2008.	[func]*		tomek
	The support for benchmarks have been removed.
	(Gitlab #2372)

2007.	[func]		tmark
	Added split() function to classification expression
	language.
	(GitLab #2272)

2006.	[func]		slawek
	Added ``service-sockets-require-all`` parameter to specify
	mandatory successfully binding all needed service sockets to
	initialize DHCP services (defaults to false). If any socket is
	unavailable, then the service fails to start. Added
	``service-sockets-max-retries`` parameter (defaults to 0) to
	specify the number of retries to open unavailable sockets and
	``service-sockets-retry-wait-time`` parameter to specify a time
	interval to wait between attempts.
	(Gitlab #1716)

2005.	[func]*		razvan
	The support for Cassandra database backend has been removed.
	(Gitlab #2116)

Kea 2.1.4 (development) released on March 30, 2022

2004.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.4 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2363)

2003.	[func]		fdupont
	Added the support of sub-options in the flex_option
	hook library.
	(GitLab #2314)

2002.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed a bug in MySql config backend that caused it to
	store unspecified, client-class valid and preferred life
	time values as zero in the database.
	(Gitlab #2344)

2001.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug which causes client classes with empty test
	expressions to fail class evaluation when those classes are
	retrieved from config backend.
	(Gitlab #2336)

2000.	[func]		fdupont
	Added the ``early-global-reservations-lookup`` configuration
	parameter which allows to perform a search for global host
	reservations and set client classes before the subnet
	selection. This is achieved when explicitly configured to
	``true`` and it defaults to ``false`` if not configured.
	(Gitlab #2249)

1999.	[func]		tmark, razvan
	The kea-dhcp6 server fully supports using PostgreSQL for config
	backend. This should be considered an experimental feature.
	(Gitlab #2355, #2356)

1998.	[func]		tmark, razvan
	With the addition of support for client classes, the kea-dhcp4
	server now fully supports using PostgreSQL for config backend.
	(Gitlab #2322)

1997.	[bug]		tmark
	The obsolete log message, DHCP4_NCR_CREATE, has been
	removed from kea-dhcp4.
	(GitLab #2301)

Kea 2.1.3 (development) released on Feb 23, 2022

1996.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.3 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2317)

1995.	[func]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now supports using PostgreSQL for config
	backend for everything except client classes. The
	new hook library is libdhcp_pgsql_cb.so. This should
	be considered an experimental feature.
	(Gitlab #95)

1994.	[func]		razvan
	Added support for Server Identifier Override RAI sub-option
	(RFC 5107). The implementation is not complete according to the
	RFC, because the server does not store the RAI, but the
	functionality handles expected use cases.
	(Gitlab #1695)

1993.	[func]		razvan
	Added global and per subnet counters for allocation failures:
	``v4-allocation-fail``, ``v4-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``v4-allocation-fail-subnet``, ``v4-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``v4-allocation-fail-classes``, ``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-subnet``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-classes``,
	``v6-allocation-fail``, ``v6-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``v6-allocation-fail-subnet``, ``v6-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``v6-allocation-fail-classes``, ``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-subnet``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-classes``.
	There is a warning log message emitted in the logs each time one
	of the allocation failure counters is incremented.
	(Gitlab #2054)

1992.	[bug]		razvan
	The ``maxver`` and ``maxsize`` logger parameters are excluded
	from ``config-get`` command response if the logger output is
	``stdout``, ``stderr`` or ``syslog``.
	(Gitlab #2288)

1991.	[bug]		jinmei, razvan
	Fixed keactrl exit code when netconf is not build.
	(Gitlab #2262)

1990.	[func]		razvan
	Added the ``reservations-lookup-first`` configuration parameter
	which controls whether host reservations lookup should be
	performed before lease lookup. This parameter has effect only
	when multi-threading is disabled. When multi-threading is
	enabled, host reservations lookup is always performed first. The
	``reservations-lookup-first`` parameter defaults to ``false``
	when multi-threading is disabled.
	(Gitlab #2036)

Kea 2.1.2 (development) released on Jan 26, 2022

1989.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.2 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2281)

1988.	[bug]		tmark
	Kea core logic now ensures options belonging
	to client classes are properly created when
	classes are read from configuration backends.
	(Gitlab #2246)

1987.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed an issue in PostgreSQL support code that caused
	asserts when compiled with: -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS.
	(Gitlab #2284)

1986.	[func]		fdupont
	The kea-admin command now accepts extra arguments which
	are passed to the database command tool, e.g. '--ssl' to
	'mysql' with `kea-admin ... -x --ssl'. Quotes are not
	preserved but multiple arguments can be given.
	(Gitlab #2225)

1985.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support for using files to configure basic HTTP
	credentials. Instead of configuring a value, it is taken from
	the content of a file. The new parameters of the Control Agent
	configuration are:
	- 'user-file' pointing to a file vs 'user'
	- 'password-file' pointing to a file vs 'password'
	- 'password-file' pointing to a file with the secret
	(which is <user>:<password>) vs 'user' and 'password'.
	For the High Availability hook library the new parameter
	is 'basic-auth-password-file' which can be used as an
	alternative to 'basic-auth-password'.
	(Gitlab #2006)

1984.	[func]		andrei
	Introduced the lease-upload command to kea-admin which can upload
	leases from a memfile CSV file to a database backend.
	(Gitlab #2039)

1983.	[bug]		fdupont
	Minimum and maximum values of lifetimes are no longer
	skipped when the configuration is retrieved even when
	they are the same as the default value.
	(Gitlab #2222)

1982.	[bug]		andrei
	The config for an HA peer now accepts an IPv6 address as a valid
	value for the "url" entry.
	(Gitlab #2264)

1981.	[func]		tomek
	The default-url DHCPv4 option has been replaced with
	v4-captive-portal, as defined in RFC8910.
	(Gitlab #1684)

1980.	[func]*		andrei
	The kea-admin lease-dump command now outputs a CSV file that is
	compatible with the memfile backend. This is useful when
	migrating from database to memfile. The generated output is
	backwards incompatible. Any tools that depend on it would need
	to adapt.
	(Gitlab #2038)

1979.	[bug]		fdupont
	Update and delete operations on leases no longer raise
	an error with infinite valid lifetime (used by BOOTP)
	and MySQL or PostgreSQL backends where timestamps can
	be limited to 32 bits.
	(Gitlab 897)

1978.	[doc]		tomek
	The Kea Administrator Reference Manual now correctly states that
	DHCPv6 authentication option has code 11, not 10.
	(Gitlab #2207)

1977.	[bug]		razvan
	Use only MAX_HWADDR_LEN (20) bytes from remote-id when extracting
	the MAC from relay options.
	(Gitlab #2201)

1976.	[func]		andrei
	Added hwtype and hwaddr_source columns to v6 memfile.
	(Gitlab #2236)

1975.	[func]		tmark
	Additional changes and corrections relating to Config Backend
	were made to the PostgreSQL database schema.  In addition, the
	upgrade scripts were renamed to ensure proper file name ordering.
	Note that PostgreSQL CB is not yet functional.
	(Gitlab #2183, #2244, #2245)

1974.	[func]		fdupont
	The global parameter lookup has been refactored to provide better
	performance. Proper return error code (CONTROL_RESULT_ERROR) has
	been fixed in some cases when trying to apply the new
	configuration. Old code was using wrong hardcoded '2' value
	(CONTROL_RESULT_COMMAND_UNSUPPORTED).
	(Gitlab #1082)

1973.	[func]		fdupont
	MySQL backends now can be configured to use the SSL/TLS
	support to protect connections to the server. New
	database parameters are "cert-file", "key-file",
	"trust-anchor" and "cipher-list". The negotiated cipher
	name is logged so the MySQL service configuration can
	be checked. PostgreSQL accepts the same parameters
	but they only trigger the call to the OpenSSL generic
	initialization in the Pq C-API.
	(Gitlab #34)

1972.	[func]		andrei
	Kea servers now can accept trailing commas in file
	configurations. While parsing, a warning is printed with the
	location of the comma to give the user the ability to correct
	a mistake.
	(Gitlab #2084)

1971.	[func]		tmark, jad
	Added support for embedded DHCPv6 DUIDs within DHCPv4
	Client Identifier options per RFC 4361.  This allows
	Kea to support DDNS in dual stack environments per
	RFC 4703(Sec 5.2). Thanks to John Dickinson for
	contributing the patch!
	(Gitlab #1934)

Kea 2.1.1 (development) released on Nov 24, 2021

	Fixed "make check -j N" running tests in parallel in src/lib/log.
	(Gitlab #2172)

1968.	[build]		andrei
	Fixed make check failing when googletest support was disabled.
	(Gitlab #2167)

1967.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed a bug where keactrl did not color the active status code

	Added support for Debian 11 in hammer.py.
	(Gitlab #2042, #2193)

1963.	[func]		andrei
	hammer.py has had several improvements.
	NETCONF and PostgreSQL will be properly configured when running
	prepare-system on Fedora and FreeBSD.
	vagrant will be automatically upgraded if it is too outdated.
	Error messages are more clear when running on unsupported
	systems.
	hammer.py is now able to detect Arch Linux distributions and
	offers limited support for it, being able to prepare-system with
	freeradius and netconf support.
	(Gitlab #2111, #2112)

1962.	[func]		andrei
	kea-netconf updates: fixed store-extended-info, it was an
	operational node instead of a config node. Added several
	containers and leaves: compatibility, lenient-option-parsing,
	multi-threading, enable-multi-threading, packet-queue-size,
	thread-pool-size, valid-lifetime, min-valid-lifetime,
	max-valid-lifetime, preferred-lifetime, min-preferred-lifetime,
	max-preferred-lifetime, cache-max-age, cache-threshold,
	ddns-generated-prefix, ddns-override-client-update,

	ARM. The relevant section of the ARM was previously referring
	to a dead link in the Log4cpp documentation.
	(Gitlab #2134)

1958.	[func]		tomek, tmark
	PostgreSQL database schema has been extended with tables for
	Config Backend (CB). This is the first step towards PostgreSQL
	CB. However, as there is no code yet to use those new tables,
	they're not not functional yet.
	(Gitlab #90, #2166)

Kea 2.1.0 (development) released on Oct 27, 2021

1957.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.0 development
	version.

	Added a description and an example of the usage of the "include"
	statement in the Kea configuration file to the ARM.
	(Gitalb #2080)

1949.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp6 now correctly determines DNS update flags when
	the allocation engine dynamically changes the selected
	network subnet.
	(Gitlab #1622)

1948.	[func]		tmark

	Fixes a bug in MySQL configuration backend schema. DHCP options
	associated with deleted client classes are now automatically
	deleted.
	(Gitlab #2094)

1945.	[build]		andrei
	Reverted qa#261 changes, which forced linking with OpenSSL 1.1
	when available. This caused a segfault, when Kea's crypto library
	used OpenSSL 1.1, but the MySQL library it linked against, used
	OpenSSL 1.0.
	(Gitlab #2081)

1944.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 both now support a global parameter,
	parked-packet-limit, that can be used to limit the number
	of client responses the server may park pending completion
	of hook library callouts.
	(Gitlab #1307)

1943.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in fetching client classes from the Config Backend.
	The bug resulted in failures during attempts to evaluate the
	classes for a received packet.
	(Gitlab #2077)

	Added basic statistics to the DHCP-DDNS server.
	(Gitlab #2040)

1941.	[func]		fdupont
	Per DNS server TSIG keys are now supported in the DHCP-DDNS
	(aka D2) server configuration. A new callout point 'select_key'
	gives access to the selected TSIG key before sending DNS updates.

Kea 1.9.11 (development) released on Aug 30, 2021

1940.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.11 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2053)

1939.	[bug]		tmark
	Removed all MultiThreadingCriticalSections from lease_cmds
	hooks library which can cause a dead-lock when running HA+MT.
	The commands simply try to acquire the resource lock and fail
	if the resource is unavailable also logging an error message.
	(Gitlab #2051)

1938.	[bug]		razvan
	Fix dead locks caused by commands with CS on http listener
	threads and CS on main thread racing with CS on other threads.
	(Gitlab #2041, #2043)

1937.	[bug]		razvan
	The Config Backend is now capable of reestablishing database
	connection after a failure.
	(Gitlab #1982)

1936.	[build]		andrei
	Kea attempts to first link with compatibility library OpenSSL 1.1
	(usually found on CentOS 7) before falling back to the system
	OpenSSL (1.0 on CentOS 7 which is out of support).
	(Gitlab qa#261)

1935.	[func]		andrei
	The store-extended-info config entry was added to Kea YANG
	modules at root-level and at subnet-level.
	(Gitlab #1944)

1934.	[func]		tmark
	Kea-dhcp6 now supports specifying valid-lifetime and
	preferred-lifetime values in client classes (via both
	configuration file and Config Backend).  Prior to this
	it could only be specified at the global, shared-network,
	and subnet scopes.
	(Gitlab #1710)

1933.	[doc]		fdupont, tomek
	Added a new ARM section about GSS-TSIG. Currently it describes
	how to build Kea with GSS-API support. It will be expanded in
	the future.
	(Gitlab #2018)

1932.	[func]		tmark
	MySQL indexing of leases database has been improved. It now
	behaves better on older MySQL versions. In particular, the lease
	reclamation no longer causes full scans to be performed. This
	fix introduces MySQL schema update to 11.0. This should reduce
	the periodic performance slowdowns.
	(Gitlab #2030)

1931.	[bug]		tomek
	Two hook messages HOOKS_CALLOUT_ERROR and HOOKS_CALLOUT_MESSAGES

	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.10 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1984)

1926.	[func]*		marcin
	Server tags in the MySQL database are now represented as strings
	with a maximum length of 64 characters. Previously, the server
	tags could be up to 256 characters long, and it could cause
	database migrations to fail on the systems with UTF-8 encoding
	configured for MySQL. Shorter server tags avoid hitting the
	limitation on the maximum length of an indexed table column.
	(Gitlab #1976)

	sysrepo v1.4.140 + libyang v1.0.240.
	Support for legacy Sysrepo versions v0.x has been dropped.
	(Gitlab #1077)

1922.	[func]		marcin
	Added support for storing client classes in the MySQL config

1917.	[func]		tomek
	DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are now more consistent when logging the
	reasons	why a packet was dropped. This information is now
	available on debuglevel 15. Also added a section in the ARM
	discussing the debug levels. The subnet selection failed log
	message now provides more useful information about the subnet.
	(Gitlab #1915, #1916)

	DOCSIS options are no longer offered to any vendor other than
	Cable Labs (vendor-id == 4491). This was not an explicit check

	certain conditions.
	(Gitlab #1894)

1914.	[func]*		tomek
	The Cassandra (CQL) support is being deprecated, both for
	leases and host backends. For the time being the features

	However, the functionality will be removed in the future
	Kea releases.
	(Gitlab #1892)

1911.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed a minor regression where kea-admin and keactrl would output
	technical errors like "unbound variable" instead of more helpful
	messages like "missing backend" because of the undefined variable
	checks introduced in 1.9.4. Added tests to further prevent it.

	Experimental support for Heimdal implementation of GSS-API
	with Kerberos 5 added.
	(Gitlab #1909)

1908.	[func]		razvan
	Added export for V4 option 82 (DHO_DHCP_AGENT_OPTIONS) and
	respective suboptions 1 (RAI_OPTION_AGENT_CIRCUIT_ID) and
	suboption 2 (RAI_OPTION_REMOTE_ID) in the run script hooks

1906.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support for the TKEY DNS resource record.
	(Gitlab #1880)

1905.	[build]		fdupont
	Added an optional --with-gssapi switch to the configure

1903.	[func]		andrei
	Kea now recognizes requests sent from vendors that include their
	information in DHCPv6 Vendor Class option (code 16) for the
	purpose of offering custom options in the response. Previously,
	only the Vendor-specific Information option (code 17) was
	searched for a vendor ID. For the purpose of classification, both
	options are looked into, now, just as before.
	(Gitlab #1837)

1902.	[func]		andrei, fdupont
	All logs that expose configuration, either in full or in snippets
	now have the values of "password" and "secret" entries replaced
	with asterisks "*****".
	(Gitlab #1721)

1901.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in DHCPv4 subnet selection. The server ignored
	the Subnet Selection option supplied by a client if its query
	contained a Relay Agent Information (RAI) option without a Link
	Selection option. After this change, the server respects the
	Subnet Selection option when RAI lacks the Link Selection
	option. If RAI includes it, it takes precedence over the Subnet
	Selection option.
	(Gitlab #1816)

1900.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed a sporadic failure caused by a wrong assertion in
	unit test, testMtHttpClientTest.workPauseResumeShutdown,
	introduced by #1818.
	(Gitlab #1876)

1899.	[func]		tmark,razvan
	In HA+Mt mode, the HA hook library now pauses and resumes
	its worker threads when Kea core enters and exits critical
	sections, respectively.  This eliminates race conditions
	during core processing such as reconfiguration, shutdown,
	and certain RESTful API commands.
	(Gitlab #1818)

1898.	[func]		fdupont
	The DROP class may now depend on the KNOWN or UNKNOWN classes
	and may be used after the host reservation lookup.
	(Gitlab #1815)

1897.	[func]		andrei
	Kea has a new configuration section called "compatibility" geared
	towards non-compliant clients. The only boolean parameter added
	for now called "lenient-option-parsing" changes the way DHCPv6
	option 16's vendor-class-data field is parsed. When enabled,
	instead of complaining that a length exceeds the rest of the
	option's buffer, the value is considered to be the rest of the
	buffer. This also applies to custom options defined with the
	tuple type for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
	(Gitlab #1860)

1896.	[func]		wlodek
	Perfdhcp extended to send v6 traffic from multiple networks.
	(Gitlab #1416)

1895.	[func]		razvan
	Added additional evaluation tokens to extract and print data:
	addrtotext, int8totext, int16totext, int32totext, uint8totext,
	uint16totext, uint32totext.
	(Gitlab #1680)

1894.	[func]		fdupont
	Implemented 'auth' logger, dedicated to logging access
	control information, such as basic HTTP authentication.
	(Gitlab #1590)

1893.	[func]		fdupont
	Botan 2.14 or later can now be used as a crypto library for
	the TLS/HTTPS support in Kea.

1890.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added a new section to the ARM, Kea Security, which describes
	various security related topics and how to address them.
	(Gitlab #1587)

1889.	[func]		fdupont
	Accept comments (shell '#', C++ '//' and C '/*...*/') in
	JSON commands sent via the control channel or the Control
	Agent.
	(Gitlab #1652)

1888.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new operational mode, HA+MT, to the HA hook library.
	HA+MT provides direct, multi-threaded HTTP communication
	between peers for the exchange HA protocol commands and
	responses.
	(Gitlab #1736)

1887.	[build]		andrei, fdupont
	Migrated autoconf macros, which became warningly deprecated
	since autoconf 2.70, to supported macros.
	(Gitlab #1632, #1651)

1886.	[doc]		tomek
	Added a section in the ARM explaining the relationship between
	keactrl and systemd scripts.
	(Gitlab #1759)

1885.	[func]		andrei
	kea-admin is now able to interactively ask for a password if no
	parameter follows the -p or the --password parameters. This
	requires the user to give it as the last parameter. The entered
	password is not echoed back to the terminal in order to prevent
	over-the-shoulder snooping or other social engineering
	techniques. Alternatively, you can set the password via the
	KEA_ADMIN_DB_PASSWORD environment variable.
	(Gitlab #1675)

1884.	[doc]		fdupont
	HTTP_CONNECTION_HANDSHAKE_FAILED log message got a

Kea 1.9.6 (development) released on March 31, 2021

1883.	[build]		andrei
	Bump library versions for Kea 1.9.6 release.
	(Gitlab #1772)

1882.	[func]		razvan
	Implemented database connection recovery for forensic logging.
	To achieve this, the "on-fail" connection parameter has been
	added to control the action performed on connection loss.
	The supported values are "stop-retry-exit", "serve-retry-exit"
	and "serve-retry-continue". They indicate if the server should
	disable the service on connection loss ("stop-retry-exit") or if
	on recovery failure the server should shut down
	("stop-retry-exit" and "serve-retry-exit") or continue
	("serve-retry-continue"). The default value used (if not
	configured) is "stop-retry-exit" for lease, host and config
	backends, and "serve-retry-continue" for forensic log.
	(Gitlab #1621)

1881.	[func]		fdupont
	Moved errors about URLs using names (vs addresses) or
	https (vs http) scheme in High Availability hook
	configuration from connection opening time to
	configuration time.
	(Gitlab #1758)

1880.	[build]		fdupont
	TLS support is now reported by configure in the
	cryptographic backend section.
	(Gitlab #1774)

1879.	[func]		fdupont
	The Control Agent now supports TLS/HTTPS. This works with
	OpenSSL and there are known problems with Botan, which will
	be addressed in the future.
	(Gitlab #1662)

1878.	[bug]		razvan
	Request enabling DHCP service when the HA hooks library is
	unloaded. It may remain disabled if it had been disabled
	outside of the HA hooks library. Prior to this change, if
	the HA hooks library disabled the DHCP service it would
	always remain disabled after the hooks library was unloaded.
	(Gitlab #1697)

1877.	[func]		fdupont
	kea-shell supports TLS/HTTPS. This is limited to the python 3
	version i.e. if kea-shell is configured with python 2 it still
	works in 1.9.6 but raises an error if a new TLS/HTTPS argument
	is specified.
	(Gitlab #1663)

1876.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added documentation for TLS/HTTPS support.
	(Gitlab #1664)

1875.	[func]		fdupont
	TLS/HTTPS support was added to asiolink and http libraries.
	(Gitlab #1661)

1874.	[doc]		marcin
	Added notes in the ARM highlighting that the address and
	delegated prefix pools must be split when HA load-balancing
	mode is used.
	(Gitlab #1726)

1873.	[func]		andrei
	kea-admin now accepts the -P|--port parameter with a custom
	port used to connect to the database.
	(Gitlab #1674)

Kea 1.9.5 (development) released on Feb 24, 2021

1872.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.5 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1713)

1871.	[bug]		andrei
	The cache threshold feature introduced in 1.9.4 modified
	previously versioned schema 9.5. This caused problems for people
	who had already upgraded to 9.5 which in Kea versions means 1.9.2
	and 1.9.3.
	In this change, the upgrade commands were moved to schema 9.6 and
	are only applied if the database does not contain the required
	columns. Affected Kea installments can now be upgraded to 1.9.5
	and above seamlessly.
	(Gitlab #1698)

1870.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a crash when using the Kea Legal Log Hooks Library with
	multi-threading. This bug was affecting only database backends.
	The log file backend was not affected by this bug.
	(Gitlab #1711)

1869.	[func]		tmark
	Kea-dhcp4 now supports specifying valid-lifetime in client
	classes.  Prior to this it could only be specified at the
	global, shared-network, and subnet scopes.
	(Gitlab #1635)

1868.	[func]		andrei
	The forensic log hook library has gained an auto-increment
	primary key column in it's logs table. It is now able to function
	in a MySQL Percona cluster which requires a primary key for all
	it's tables when configured with pxc_strict_mode = ENFORCING
	which is also the default value.
	(Gitlab #1709)

1867.	[bug]		andrei
	MySQL connection unit tests have been modified to work with
	Percona cluster. This change doesn't fix all problems, but it
	improves the situation sufficiently to be able to run unit tests
	with positive results on a Percona cluster.
	(Gitlab #1708)

1866.	[func]		marcin
	Added new log messages issued when a dynamic lease allocation
	fails. The new messages provide comprehensive information about
	the circumstances in which the failure occurred. In particular,
	they state whether the client is connected to a shared network
	or not. If it is, the shared network name is provided. Otherwise,
	the client's subnet id is logged. The new messages also inform
	from how many subnets the server attempted to allocate a lease
	and how many subnets could not be used because of non-matching
	client classes.
	(Gitlab #1701)

1865.	[func]		razvan
	Implemented the Run Script hooks library which can be used to
	run external scripts for specific packet processing hook points.
	There are several exported environment variables available for
	the script. Currently the implementation is nonblocking and
	Kea will not wait for the script to finish execution before
	continuing to the next step. For this reason, the next step
	provided by the script is ignored.
	(Gitlab #899)

1864.	[func]		fdupont
	New parameters to handle TLS support added in Control Agent
	config: "trust-anchor", "cert-file", "key-file" and
	"cert-required". They can be configured, but their values are
	not yet used.
	(Gitlab #1662)

1863.	[func]		andrei
	The perfdhcp tool now supports the -x l option that exports the
	assigned leases to stdout in CSV format. This new capability is
	very useful for the ongoing DB cluster experiments, where we need
	to correlate leases between multiple Kea instances sharing the
	same cluster.
	(Gitlab #1703)

1862.	[build]		andrei
	Added execution permissions to the upgrade scripts in Kea's
	installation. Previously kea-admin db-upgrade would fail with a
	permission denied error. It started manifesting in 1.9.3 and
	affected 1.9.4 as well. Additionally, now, when running make in
	the source repository to recreate scripts e.g. kea-admin, after a
	change to the .in files e.g. kea-admin.in, they maintain the
	execution permissions granted in the initial build. This makes
	development more seamless.
	(Gitlab #1681)

1861.	[bug]*		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now uses the value for each fixed field (e.g.
	next-server, server-hostname, boot-file-name) from the
	first class in query's list of classes that specifies the
	field. Prior to this it used the value from the last class
	which specified the field. It may be necessary to revise
	existing configurations to get the desired values.
	(Gitlab #1672)

Kea 1.9.4 (development) released on Jan 27, 2021

1860.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.4 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1666)

1859.	[doc]		wlodek
	Added example files with configured Vendor Specific Information
	option (code 43) and Vendor-Identifying Vendor-specific
	Information option (code 125) with several suboptions each.
	(Gitlab #1546)

1858.	[bug]		razvan
	The DHCP service can be independently enabled or disabled by
	the user command, by the database connection mechanics or
	by the HA library. The DHCP service is disabled when any
	of those originators disables the service, and it is enabled
	when all those who previously disabled the service enable it.
	The 'dhcp-enable' and 'dhcp-disable' commands accept 'origin'
	parameter with valid values of 'user' (which is the default)
	indicating a user generated command and 'ha-partner' which is
	used internally by the HA library.
	(Gitlab #1601)

1857.	[build]		andrei
	Code format styles meant to be as close as possible to the
	recommended coding guidelines are now included with the Kea
	source repository in the form of .clang-format and
	.uncrustify.cfg. The clang-format.sh and uncrustify.sh scripts in
	the tools directory can be used to apply these styles to chosen
	files. See coding guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
	(Gitlab #1455)

1856.	[bug]		razvan
	When using the config backend, the server converts the old
	'reservation-mode' global parameter internally to new
	reservation flags. The new flags are listed when issuing the
	config-get command.
	(Gitlab #1598)

1855.	[func]		marcin
	Improved failover procedure in Kea High Availability library
	by introducing new communication-recovery state. In this
	state the load balancing servers remain responsive to DHCP
	queries when the communication between them is interrupted.
	The new feature is controlled using the delayed-updates-limit
	configuration parameter.
	(Gitlab #1402)

1854.	[func, perf]	fdupont
	Implemented "lease caching", a feature similar to ISC
	DHCP's dhcp-cache-threshold. Lease caching is configured
	through two new parameters: cache-max-age and cache-threshold,
	and is supported by both kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6. When enabled,
	lease-caching allows the server to skip updating lease storage,
	when a client is requesting it's own pre-existing lease whose
	age falls under the cache threshold and for which there are no
	substantive changes to lease values such as the hostname.
	(Gitlab #1418)

1853.	[func]		fdupont
	Populated the space field of option definitions. This solved
	reported bugs where a specific standard option processing
	was applied to an option from another space but sharing the
	same code. In particular, this fixes the problem reported
	with vendor suboption 125.
	(Gitlab #1585)

1852.	[bug]		razvan
	Corrected the value of unacked-clients-left returned in response
	to the status-get command and the corresponding log messages.
	The previously returned value was too low by 1.
	(Gitlab #1578)

1851.	[func]		fdupont
	Removed methods fetching leases by both client identifier
	and hardware addresses from the API.
	(Gitlab #1540)

1850.	[build]		andrei
	Add two scripts to help with code aesthetics, insight on how Kea
	is built or minor build optimizations:
	* ./tools/check-for-duplicate-includes.sh: warns you if
	there is a source file that includes the same header twice.
	While this wouldn't normally result in any errors, it is an
	unusual practice. If you feel that a header should be included
	twice in a file, add the file under "# Exceptions:" in the
	script.
	* ./tools/print-generated-files.sh: prints all the files
	that are generated which may or may not be part of the
	repository. These consist of messages, parser files, and "built
	sources" (as called in Makefile.am files).
	(Gitlab #1602)

1849.	[doc]		tomek
	Two known DHCPv4 RFC violations are now documented in the ARM.
	They are both cases where Kea deliberately deviates from the
	RFC to accommodate some common broken-client behaviors.
	(Gitlab #1608, #1615)

1848.	[bug]		razvan
	The cql upgrade script from schema v3.0 to v4.0 was broken in
	Kea-1.9.3 and has been fixed also enabling the unittest.
	(Gitlab #1616)

Kea 1.9.3 (development) released on Dec 16, 2020

1847.	[bug]		andrei
	Harden shell scripts and fix some of the resulted test failures.
	* #!/bin/sh for all scripts
	* set -eu in all scripts
	* shellcheck all scripts, and fix all shellcheck warnings
	* and more...
	(Gitlab #1574)

1846.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.3 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1605)

1845.	[func]		marcin
	Kea configuration now allows for using database passwords
	which include whitespace.
	(Gitlab #692)

1844.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in Kea Control Agent error responses when a
	malformed command was sent. In some cases a map with an error
	response was returned instead of a list.
	(Gitlab #432)

1843.	[func]		andrei
	Allow perfdhcp to request options via option 55 PRL. perfdhcp
	adds option 55 with a few requested options by default so in
	order to allow `perfdhcp -o 55,abcd` special logic to merge all
	the buffers of option 55 was implemented. Works with multiple
	`-o` arguments.
	(Gitlab #1508)

1842.	[func]		razvan
	Fixed the db connection reconnect implementation to honor
	each connection backend configuration. The most important
	improvement is that only the affected manager will be
	recreated when a connection is lost. Previously, even
	managers which were not affected had to be recreated on
	any connection loss. Also fixed an issue with recovery
	when multi-threading is enabled.
	(Gitlab #1375)

1841.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected issues with inheritance of the DHCPv6 interface-id
	parameter. When interface-id is set at shared network level
	but not at the subnet level this setting is properly propagated
	to the config backend and reported when responding to the
	config-get command. Prior to this change, if the interface-id
	was set for a shared network, it was always returned for the
	subnets belonging to this shared network, even when subnet
	specific value was not specified.
	(Gitlab #652)

1840.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed the inheritance of the triple min-valid-lifetime,
	valid-lifetime and max-valid-lifetime parameters from
	the global scope, and fixed it for preferred-lifetime too.
	Added a sanity check refusing incorrect settings, e.g.
	the lifetime not being between min and max values.
	(Gitlab #1456)

1839.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 now calculate the DDNS TTL value
	based on RFC 4702, Section 5 which suggests that the
	TTL value be 1/3 of the lease's valid life time with a
	minimum value of 10 minutes. Prior to this the servers
	set the TTL to equal to the lease's valid life time.
	(Gitlab #936)

1838.	[bug]		fdupont
	The DHCPv6 sent multiple instances of an option or a
	sub-option when it seems to be requested more than once
	directly by the client or using the always-send flag.
	(Gitlab #1449)

1837.	[doc]		cstrotm
	Several Kea ARM corrections.
	(Gitlab #1514)

Kea 1.9.2 (development) released on Nov 25, 2020

1836.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.2 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1555)

1835.	[doc]		peterd
	Several Kea ARM corrections.
	(Gitlab #1536)

1834.	[func]		fdupont
	Added two new callouts (hook points) in the control agent.
	The "auth" callout is executed after the basic authentication
	(if configured) and the command processing. The "response"
	callout is executed after the command processing and before
	the HTTP response is returned.
	(Gitlab #1421)

1833.	[doc]		sgoldlust
	Many documentation corrections.
	(Gitlab #1539)

1832.	[func]		tomek, wlodek
	Perfdhcp extended with functionality to gradually
	increase elapsed time in solicit and secs field in offer.
	(Gitlab #1332)

1831.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed the DHCPv6 server implementation of the
	reservations-out-of-pool flag to match the DHCPv4 one. When the
	flag is true:
	* the server assumes that all reserved address do not belong to
	  the dynamic pool.
	* the server will not assign reserved addresses that are inside
	  the dynamic pool to the respective clients.
	* addresses matching the respective reservations from inside
	  the dynamic pools (if any) can be dynamically assigned to any
	  client.
	(Gitlab #1550)

1830.	[func]		fdupont, razvan
	Added new configuration options reservations-global,
	reservations-in-subnet and reservations-out-of-pool to replace
	the old reservation-mode parameter. The new flags can be
	configured independently, adding support for new configuration
	scenarios when global and in subnet reservations are both
	active.
	(Gitlab #1405)

1829.	[bug]		fdupont, razvan
	Fixed a bug in the hasAddressReservation function which was
	causing the search for reservations to end as soon as no global
	reservation was found when configuring a subnet or shared
	network with global reservations enabled.
	(Gitlab #1405)

1828.	[bug]		andrei, razvan
	Fix trivial logic error in handling the "lease4-update" command
	manifesting itself on v4 if multi-threading is enabled.
	Notable affected environment is a HA with the
	"send-lease-updates" configuration setting explicitly set to
	true. Prior to this fix, lease updates would not go through to
	other HA nodes, even though some log lines would say they would.
	A simple workaround prior to this fix is to disable
	multi-threading.
	(Gitlab #1542)

1827.	[build]		andrei
	Add `tools/add-config-h.sh` script that can add
	`#include <config.h>` lines to non-generated source files that
	are missing it.
	(Gitlab #1453)

Kea 1.9.1 (development) released on Oct 28, 2020

1826.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.1 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1481)

1825.	[doc]		andrei
	Examples for option definitions, option data, standardized option
	spaces other than "dhcp[46]", custom option spaces, option
	embedding under doc/examples/kea[46]/all-options.json.
	(Gitlab #1298)

1824.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new parameter, ddns-use-conflict-resolution, to
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6. This parameter is passed per request
	to kea-dhcp-ddns which uses it to determine whether or not
	conflict resolution rules (see RFC 4703) are followed for that
	request.  The default value is true. Disabling conflict
	resolution should only be used after careful consideration.
	(Gitlab #1386)

1823.	[doc]		tomek
	Updated options documentation for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
	(Gitlab #1436, #1460)

1822.	[func]		fdupont
	When multi-threading is enabled the status-get command displays
	the average length of the multi-threading packet queue for last
	10, 100 and 1000 packets.
	(Gitlab #1306)

1821.	[func]		anonymous, fdupont
	The forensic log hook library now logs release and decline
	events.
	(Gitlab #1445)

1820.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed lease update when using HA and lease_cmds hooks with
	database backend. Previously, HA updates were rejected because
	the database backend rejects operations on the lease if the old
	expiration time is different than what it is already stored, to
	act as a protection mechanism for parallel updates from several
	threads or processes.
	(Gitlab #1434)

1819.	[func]		fdupont
	Improved error messages for bad escapes in JSON strings.
	(Gitlab #151)

1818.	[doc]		andrei
	Add to the reservation documentation:
	* instructions on how to choose "reservation-mode"
	* priority of "reservation-mode" specified at all levels
	* priority of file reservations vs database reservations
	(Gitlab #1299)

1817.	[func]		fdupont
	Redact control agent logs to hide basic HTTP authentication
	passwords from the configuration files. Note that when HTTP
	headers are logged credentials are present in clear text.
	(Gitlab #1459)

1816.	[func]		fdupont
	The message logged when basic HTTP authentication succeed is
	now informative (was DEBUG, is INFO now).
	(Gitlab #1450)

1815.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed libdhcpsrv build failures when building without database
	backends.
	(Gitlab #1468)

1814.	[func]		marcin
	Added ip-reservations-unique global parameter which controls
	whether or not it is allowed to create multiple host reservations
	for the same IP address or delegated prefix. By default, it is
	not allowed to create multiple reservations for the same lease
	within the same subnet. This change facilitates the use case
	in which a single host can communicate with the DHCP server over
	multiple network interfaces but should be assigned the same
	reserved lease regardless of which interface is used.
	(Gitlab #1428)

1813.	[func]		tmark
	A new parameter, ddns-update-on-renew, has been added to
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 configuration.  When true, the server
	will always update DNS when a lease is renewed even if the DNS
	information for the lease has not changed. The prior, and now
	default, behavior is for the server to only update DNS for a
	renewing lease if its DNS information has changed.
	(Gitlab #1385)

1812.	[doc]		andrei
	Document how MAC addresses can be formatted for use as attributes
	in RADIUS authentication
	(Gitlab #1441)

1811.	[func]		fdupont
	Two new parameters were added: cache-threshold and cache-max-age
	to the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 global scopes. They will govern the
	upcoming cache threshold feature. The parameters can be set and
	retrieved, but they're not used yet.
	(Gitlab #1418)

Kea 1.9.0 (development) released on Sep 30, 2020

1810.	[build]		fdupont, razvan
	Bump up libs version for Kea 1.9.0 release.
	(Gitlab #1400)

1809.	[func]		razvan
	Added csv-format option to flex_option hook to be able to insert
	option data in csv format. The implicit value is false,
	maintaining compatibility with the previous default raw format.
	(Gitlab #1373)

1808.	[func]		razvan
	Support for new IPv6-only-preferred option for DHCPv4 has been
	added. It lets Kea to signal to compatible devices that the
	IPv6 connectivity is available and they can disable their
	IPv4 stack. This implements support for draft-ietf-dhc-v6only-08,
	which is expected to be soon published by IETF as an RFC.
	(Gitlab #1351)

1807.	[doc]		tomek
	Added separate table with DHCPv4 options that are governed by Kea
	itself, rather than configured by administrator.
	(Gitlab #1323, #1398)

1806.	[bug]		tmark
	The DNS update code behaving better when there is a shared
	network and the code initially selected one subnet, but then
	later determined that a different subnet will be used. There
	is still a corner-case in DHCPv6 if the client requests multiple
	addresses or multiple prefixes and some of them is serviced from
	one subnet and some from another.
	(Gitlab #1389)

1805.	[doc]		tomek
	API documentation for lease4-get-* and lease6-get-* commands
	has been updated.
	(Gitlab #1392)

1804.	[func]		fdupont
	Added a new reservation-get-by-id command to retrieve all host
	reservations with an identifier value and type. Made the
	subnet-id optional in the reservation-get-page command.
	(Gitlab #1163)

1803.	[doc]		fdupont
	Corrected Kea ARM sections describing how to send DHCPv6
	Vendor-specific Information Option (code 17) with sub-options.
	(Gitlab #1025)

1802.	[bug]		fdupont
	Removed the bug which allowed for repeating the same
	configuration parameter multiple times in the same scope.
	The second occurrence of the parameter overwrote the first
	occurrence causing server misconfiguration. Starting from
	this change an error is raised when the same parameter occurs
	multiple times in a given scope the location of the first value.
	(Gitlab #1102)

1801.	[doc]		fdupont
	Moved JSON files describing commands to the share directory
	and adding a new access entry taking read or write values.
	(Gitlab #1240)

1800.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support of basic HTTP authentication in HTTP library,
	control agent, kea shell and high availability hook.
	(Gitlab #1304)

1799.	[bug]		fdupont
	Checked execution of queries to get schema versions of MySQL
	and PostgreSQL database in kea-admin.
	(Gitlab #828)

1798.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now correctly updates DNS when a client
	returns for lease after the lease has expired.  Prior
	to this, the server would remove the entries but then
	fail to add them unless the hostname (or FQDN) changed.
	This change also eliminates redundant DNS removes when
	expired leases are reclaimed and given to different clients.
	(Gitlab #1409)

Kea 1.8.0 (stable) released on Aug 26, 2020

1797.	[build]		razvan
	Bump up libs version for Kea 1.8.0 release.
	(Gitlab #1395)

1796.	[bug]		marcin
	Kea HTTP client re-establishes connection with the HTTP server
	when timeout occurs. Prior to this change the client tried to
	reuse the connection after timeout often getting subsequent
	timeouts. Re-establishing the connection may help avoid further
	timeouts during the High Availability operation.
	(Gitlab #1390)

1795.	[bug]		razvan
	Added check for 'renew-timer' value to be lower than or equal to
	'rebind-timer' value at subnet and shared network level.
	(Gitlab #505)

1794.	[func]		razvan
	The 'status-get' command send to DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 servers will return
	information about multi threading settings ('multi-threading-enabled',
	and only if this setting is active, 'thread-pool-size' and
	'packet-queue-size').
	(Gitlab #1305)

1793.	[doc]		tmark
	Added Leasequery hook library to the list of available hook
	libraries in the ARM.
	(Gitlab #1372)

1792.	[doc]		tmark
	Added the Database Connectivity section to the ARM which explains
	how Kea servers respond to backend database connectivity issues.
	(Gitlab #1284)

1791.	[doc]		tmark
	Updated the ARM section for the Lease Commands hook library
	which incorrectly stated that a command return value of 2 would
	be returned when no lease(s) matched the command. The value
	returned is actually 3.
	(Gitlab #1384)

1790.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in Kea Configuration Backend observed when using certain
	MariaDB	database versions. As a result of this bug the Kea servers were
	unable to fetch configurations stored in the database upon startup. The
	bug was related to the usage of timestamps which in MariaDB must be
	set to 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC or later. In some cases the Kea CB used
	out of bounds timestamp values. This bug was observed when using MariaDB
	10.4.13.
	(Gitlab #1382)

1789.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug in the lease reclaim process which would not reschedule the
	timer if the operation failed.
	(Gitlab #1335)

1788.	[bug]*		fdupont
	When a host reservation in a subnet reserves an address, the
	address must be within the subnet. This check was previously
	only done by the host command hook library. Note it does not
	apply to prefix delegation.
	(Gitlab #1254)

1787.	[bug]		razvan
	The recount leases functions consider leases in 'declined' state as
	'assigned' so that when the lease is reclaimed or reused, no negative
	counters are generated. The 'subnet[X].reclaimed-leases' and
	'reclaimed-leases' are now cumulative counters and are never
	decremented or reset until server restart. Removed references to non
	existent 'declined-reclaimed-addresses' counters.
	(Gitlab #1336)

1786.	[bug]		razvan
	Update lease stats when using commands from lease-cmds hook.
	(Gitlab #1065)

1785.	[func]		fdupont
	If enabled, the default value for queue capacity in congestion control
	has been trimmed down from 500 to 64. The feature continues to be disabled
	by default.
	(Gitlab #285)

1784.	[build]		wlodek
	Socket path in kea ddns default config was changed to
	/tmp/kea-ddns-ctrl-socket.
	(Gitlab #1379)

1783.	[doc]		tomek
	Installation instructions for RADIUS hook updated.
	(Gitlab #1310)

1782.	[bug]		tmark
	Corrected a bug that causes kea-dhcp4/kea-dhcp6 servers to crash after
	losing connectivity to a configuration backend database. The servers
	now correctly honor the max-reconnect-tries parameter.
	(Gitlab #1369)

1781.	[bug]		razvan
	Reject invalid declined state for PD prefix in add and update
	commands in lease-cmds hook.
	(Gitlab #1349)

Kea 1.7.10 (development) released on Jul 29, 2020

1780.	[doc]		wlodek
	Added a section to Kea ARM about tuning performance for kea-dhcp4
	and kea-dhcp6.
	(Gitlab #1285)

1779.	[build]		tmark
	Library version numbers bumped for release.
	(Gitlab #1346)

1778.	[func]*		fdupont
	Changed the order of subnets to follow ascending subnet identifier.
	(Gitlab #1265)

1777.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added in the Developer's Guide an example about how to cross
	compile Kea for a Raspberry Pi.
	(Gitlab #1221)

1776.	[func]		fdupont
	DHCP servers now log a fatal error message when a reconfiguration
	attempt left a no longer working server. Documentation was
	updated tp propose remedy actions.
	(Gitlab #507,#1166)

1775.	[doc]		vicky
	A Code of Conduct has been added.
	(Gitlab #1143)

1774.	[func]		tmark
	leaseX-del commands now support a new parameter, update-ddns,
	which instructs the server to remove DNS entries for a
	lease after it has been deleted.
	(Gitlab #544)

1773.	[perf]		fdupont
	Kea statistics now uses standard c++11 chrono library instead
	of POSIX time library from boost.
	(Gitlab #1174)

1772.	[perf]		fdupont
	Set kea-lfc process priority to lower than default.
	This change should alleviate CPU utilization spikes caused
	by LFC process observed on some systems.
	(Gitlab #1311)

1771.	[func]		fdupont
	Duplicate ChangeLog entry removed.

1770.	[func]		fdupont
	Added kea-admin lease-stat-recount command which recounts cached
	statistics in MySQL and PostgreSQL lease databases.
	(Gitlab #1196)

1769.	[build]		fdupont
	Added detection of the musl libc which implements dlclose() as
	a no-operation: this behavior breaks Kea expectations for
	hook library unloading.
	(Gitlab #771)

1768.	[func]*		fdupont
	Removed the support of the Logging toplevel entry. Now loggers must
	be defined in each server toplevel entry.
	(Gitlab #916)

1767.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed unit tests failing on systems where an interface is named	eth0.
	(Gitlab #1043)

1766.	[func]		fdupont
	Optimized the interface manager code and removed the 16 bit limit
	to interface indexes.
	(Gitlab #553)

1765.	[bug]		fdupont
	Corrected a bug in MySQL Config Backend which occasionally caused
	the DHCP servers to overlook some configuration changes. This
	issue could occur when the server fetched configuration changes
	within one second after they they were applied in the database.
	(Gitlab #1247)

1764.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added thread safety consideration sections to library documentations
	in the developer guide.
	(Gitlab #996,#1264)

1763.	[bug]		fdupont
	Changed the way hook libraries are unloaded. Now unload is done
	in two phases: the first phase calls unload() entry points and
	removes callouts, the second phase unmaps hook library memory
	spaces. This should lead to fewer problems including fewer crashes
	at exit time. On the other hand, incorrect libraries can stay
	in memory until exit and prevent any (re)load.
	(Gitlab #1282)

Kea 1.7.9 (development) released on June 24, 2020

1762.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed the control command execution: either it was deferred by
	DHCP packet processing or a spurious error message was logged.
	(Gitlab #1234)

1761.	[bug]		fdupont
	Found and fixed a possible source of incorrect statistics cached
	in MySQL and PostgreSQL lease databases which in some cases
	made servers fail to start.
	(Gitlab #944,#1196)

1760.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed log message on DHCPv6 IA_NA lease renew.
	(Gitlab #1276)

1759.	[bug]*		fdupont
	Fixed the way configuration global entries are parsed in DHCPv4
	and DHCPv6 servers. We expect that the change will not be visible
	for sane configurations.
	(Gitlab #1245)

1758.	[func]*		fdupont
	Earlier Kea versions converted "comment" entries to "user-context"
	scope in the configuration when using config-get. This backwards
	compatibility has now been removed. This may affect users who use
	config-get or config-write commands and use comments in their
	configurations.
	(Gitlab #1100)

1757.	[bug]		fdupont
	config-backend-pull commands were fixed to be applied to the
	current configuration
	(Gitlab #1189)

1756.	[bug]		fdupont
	Made the parking lot API generic thread safe.
	(Gitlab #1255)

1755.	[func]*		fdupont
	Implemented various race avoidance mechanisms in the multi-threaded
	packet processing: only one query from the same client is processed,
	subsequent queries from the same client are dropped at the exception
	of the most recent which will be processed after. When picking
	a free address or prefix from a pool the resource is considered
	as not free for other threads. This is used by the lease commands
	hooks library to avoid conflicts with a minimal overhead.
	Finally individual lease reclamation is exclusive of multi-threaded
	packet processing.
	(Gitlab #1147)

Kea 1.7.8 (development) released on May 27, 2020

1754.	[func]		marcin
	Improved the procedure of restarting the servers in the terminated
	HA state. The servers can now be restarted sequentially without the
	risk of returning to the terminated state right after restart.
	Previously, the servers had to be both shutdown before being
	restarted to avoid returning to the terminated state.
	(Gitlab #1205)

1753.	[func]*		marcin
	Extended the response to the status-get command to include
	information about the progress of the failover procedure
	while the active servers are in the communication interrupted
	state. The new data allow for monitoring the number of clients
	attempting to communicate with the partner which is presumably
	offline, total number of packets sent to the partner and so on.
	The syntax of the response was modified and is incompatible with
	previous Kea versions.
	(Gitlab #1087)

1752.	[doc]		tmark
	Added documentation for the Leasequery premium
	hook library to the ARM.
	(Gitlab #1180)

1751.	[perf]		marcin
	Corrected performance issue occurring while loading large configurations
	via the MySQL Config Backend. Improper database indexing caused long
	server startup time as well as long time to respond to various
	commands, such as subnet4-list or subnet6-list.
	(Gitlab #1242)

1750.	[func]		razvan
	Refactored HooksManager so that no lazy initialization is possible
	from dhcp processing functions. The function getHooksManager is now
	private.
	(Gitlab #1227)

1749.	[func]		fdupont
	When the version is a development (vs. stable) one (second
	number is odd, e.g. in 1.7.x) a server or agent logs a
	warning to dissuade use in production.
	(Gitlab #1184)

1748.	[func]		marcin
	Added two extensions to the HA hooks library. Firstly, the active
	servers no longer wait for the lease update acknowledgments from
	the backup servers. Secondly, the new passive-backup mode allows
	for running a single active server with a number of backup
	servers.
	(Gitlab #999)

1747.	[bug]		fdupont
	Multi-threading and congestion handling were made incompatible:
	when both are enabled by a configuration the dhcp-queue-control is
	silently disabled, when packet-queue-size is not 0 and the
	multi-threading packet queue is full the oldest packet is dropped
	to make room for a new received one.
	(Gitlab #1173)

1746.	[bug]		fdupont
	lease4-add and lease6-add commands now return an error when the
	lease already exists.

Kea 1.7.7 (development) released on Apr 29, 2020

1743.	[doc]		tomek
	ISC now provides a dashboard solution for Kea. Added documentation
	pointers about the ISC Stork project.
	(Gitlab #1191)

1742.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new cumulative statistics: for each assigned IPv4 address,
	IPv6 NA address or IPv6 PD prefixes cumulative-assigned-addresses,
	cumulative-assigned-nas or cumulative-assigned-pds global and
	per subnet is increased. A spelling error in the result-set of
	the stat-lease4-get of the stat cmds hook library was fixed.
	(Gitlab #816)

1741.	[func]		fdupont
	When the MySQL InnoDB reports a deadlock (very rare event)
	the failed query is rerun.
	(Gitlab #1160)

1740.	[bug]		fdupont
	Incorrect signal handling in the process library (used for
	control agent, d2 and netconf server but not by DHCPv4 or
	DHCPv6 servers) was replaced by the boost ASIO signal set.
	(Gitlab #1096)

1739.	[func]		razvan
	Added multi threading configuration parameters which can be used
	to adjust server performance according to setup resources and needs:
	enable-multi-threading, thread-pool-size and packet-queue-size.
	There is also an automatic detection implemented by using
	thread-pool-size set to 0. However, the packet-queue-size must be
	manually configured and does not scale automatically.
	The temporary -N command line option was removed.
	The multi threading is disabled by default.
	(Gitlab #893)

1738.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new global parameters statistic-default-sample-count and
	statistic-default-sample-age to set the default values used
	for sample keeping limits.
	(Gitlab #1005)

1737.	[func]		tmark
	Added store-extended-info parameter to kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6
	which enables the storage of additional information per lease.
	This has been added in anticipation of supporting LeaseQuery.
	(Gitlab #1010)

1736.	[doc]		fdupont
	A default logging syntax has been updated to reflect recently added
	multi-threading capabilities. The process is now identified by
	name/process-id.thread-id, e.g. kea-dhcp4.dhcpsrv/8475.12345, where
	12345 is the thread-id. Its exact syntax is OS dependent. The
	logging syntax can be tweaked using `pattern` option for logging.
	(Gitlab #1150)

Kea 1.7.6 (development) released on Mar 25, 2020

1735.	[func]		wlodek

1734.	[doc]		vicky
	A list of supported OSes is now described in a separate
	platforms.rst file.
	(Gitlab #1055)

1733.	[func]		tmark
	Added lease4-resend-ddns and lease6-resend-ddns commands to
	the Lease Commands hook library.  These commands may be used to
	instruct kea-dhcp4 or kea-dhcp6 to resend a request to update a
	lease's DNS entries to kea-dhcp-ddns.
	(Gitlab #1106)

1732.	[func]		marcin
	Client classes specified within host reservations can be used
	to influence subnet choice within a shared network and pool
	selection within a subnet.
	(Gitlab #1139)

1731.	[func]		razvan
	The NameChangeSender class is thread safe, making DNS updates
	compatible with multi-threading packet processing.
	(Gitlab #1148)

1730.	[func]		razvan
	Added -N command line switch that enables experimental multi-threading
	support. Number of threads can be specified (e.g. -N8) or Kea can be
	told to autodetect number of CPU threads (-N0). This feature is
	experimental. It hasn't been tested extensively and is known to cause
	problems with DDNS and HA. Do not use in production!
	(Gitlab #893)

1729.	[func]		razvan
	The RAII MultiThreadingCriticalSection class is now able to
	automatically stop and start the packet thread pool in order to
	perform server configuration and avoid race conditions in non
	thread safe code.
	(Gitlab #1016)

1728.	[bug]		tmark
	Memfile now supports commas in the hostname and user-context
	columns.  Commas in either column now escaped as "&#x2c" when
	written out, and unescaped when read back in.
	(Gitlab #608)

1727.	[bug]		tmark
	When shutting down due to lost backend database connectivity,
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 processes will exit with a non-zero value.
	This was temporarily altered by #1108. In addition, the "shutdown"
	command now supports an "exit-value" argument.
	(Gitlab #1115)

1726.	[func]		razvan
	Handling SKIP and DROP state in hooks so that the same operation
	is not performed multiple times. Some hooks will throw exceptions
	if the pktX_receive or pktX_send is handled by other hooks, in
	such case, the configuration order of the hooks must be changed.
	(Gitlab #1088)

Kea 1.7.5 (development) released on Feb 26, 2020

1725.	[func]		wlodek
	Added perfdhcp command option to enable checking address
	and/or prefix uniqueness.
	(Gitlab #1021)

1724.	[func]		razvan
	Added packet thread pool in dhcpv4 and dhcpv6 servers. It adds
	the ability to handle processPacket function on multiple threads.
	When enabled, parked packets are also added to the queue of items
	to be handles by the thread pool. The packet thread pool is
	currently disabled and there is no option to enable it yet.
	(Gitlab #892)

1723.	[func]		tmark
	Hostname sanitizing is now globally enabled by default.  Prior
	to this it was disabled.
	(Gitlab #1048)

1722.	[bug]		razvan
	Compilation fix for MySQL/MariaDB on Ubuntu 19.10.
	(Gitlab #1071)

1721.	[func]*		fdupont
	Added multi_threading_compatible function in hooks to retrieve
	the compatibility with multi-threading. This function is called
	when the library is loaded and if it reports 0 (incompatible) and
	multi-threading is enabled, then the configuration will be
	rejected. The absence of this function from the library defaults
	to incompatibility with multi-threading. All hooks and premium
	hooks must be updated to be able to be used with multi-threading.
	However, not all libraries are (or will ever be) compatible.
	(Gitlab #947)

1720.	[func]*		tomek
	The next step status in pkt4_send hook point now is able to
	distinguish between SKIP (Kea will skip packing the packet with
	the assumption that a hook already did that) and DROP (Kea will
	drop the packet). Previously both SKIP and DROP were interpreted
	as skip packing.
	(Gitlab #1090)

1719.	[func]		razvan
	Prepared CalloutManager to be used in multi-threading by moving
	the current library index and hook index to the CalloutHandle.
	This change removes the CallountHandle::getLibraryHandle, along
	with the possibility of dynamically registering/deregistering
	callouts inside callouts.
	(Gitlab #957)

1718.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 now shutdown gracefully by executing
	the shutdown command, if connectivity with a backend database
	has been lost and retries are either disabled or have been
	exhausted. Prior to this they simply invoked exit() which
	could orphan control socket files or cause segfaults unloading
	the CB Cmds hook library.
	(Gitlab #1108)

1717.	[func]		razvan
	Prepared PgSqlHostMgr to be used with multi-threading by using a
	connection pool with thread context.
	(Gitlab #1074)

1716.	[func]		razvan
	Implemented thread safe stats manager and stats context.
	(Gitlab #891)

1715.	[bug]		tmark
	Kea servers now detect and remove orphaned control channel
	sockets.  This corrects a failure of the servers to restart
	with an error of "address already in use" following a fatal
	loss of database connectivity.
	(Gitlab #1097)

Kea 1.7.4 (development) released on Jan 29, 2020

	Prepared MySqlHostMgr to be used with multi-threading by using a
	connection pool with thread context.
	(Gitlab #1073)

1710.	[bug]		fdupont
	The code that handles default parameters and parameters
	inheritance, such as applying global values to subnet level,
	has been updated slightly. Although unlikely, there is small
	possibility this may affect boot-file-name, client-class,
	interface, match-client-id, authoritative, next-server,
	reservation-mode, and server-hostname values in Subnet4 and
	client-class, interface, interface-id, rapid-commit, and
	reservation-mode in Subnet6.
	(Gitlab #724)

1709.	[func]		fdupont
	MySQL Configuration Backend now allows for storing DDNS related
	configuration in the database.
	(Gitlab #946)

1708.	[doc]		tomek
	Clarified the relationship between comments and user context.
	(Gitlab #1079)

1707.	[func]		marcin
	High Availability hooks library supports controlled maintenance
	of the servers. The new ha-maintenance-start command puts one
	of the servers in the partner-in-maintenance state and causes
	this server to take over the entire DHCP traffic directed to the
	HA service. The second server in the in-maintenance state can be
	safely shutdown for the maintenance. This new mechanism solves
	the problem present in earlier versions of Kea when the
	administrator had to rely on the failover mechanism to promote
	one of the servers to handle the DHCP traffic while the other
	server was down.
	(Gitlab #1024)

1706.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed BOOTP hook. It now properly handles BOOTP packets and sends
	valid responses.
	(Gitlab #1064)

1705.	[bug]		fdupont
	Modified option 43 parsing to interpret sub-option codes 0 and 255
	as PAD and END when no sub-option with these codes are defined.
	This adds control of illegal but common use of these reserved
	code points in option 43.
	(Gitlab #950)

1704.	[func]		fdupont
	Prepared memfile lease manager to be used with multi-threading.
	(Gitlab #894)

1703.	[bug]		niclas rozenvik
	A fix in the --with-gtest option. It is now able to detect the
	libgtest.a. Thank you to Niclas Rozenvik for reporting the issue
	and proposing a fix!
	(Gitlab #1080)

1702.	[func]		razvan
	Update and delete operations on database backends use lease old
	expire value (internal storage) to detect concurrent actions on
	the same lease.
	(Gitlab #1040)

1701.	[func]		razvan
	Initialize all option definitions at program startup instead of
	using lazy initialization to make access thread safe and lock-less.
	(Gitlab #889)

1700.	[func]		godfryd
	Enabled checking Kea merge request in GitLab CI by Danger tool
	(see https://danger.systems/guides/dangerfile.html).

Kea 1.7.3 (development) released on Nov 18th, 2019

1699.	[func]		fdupont, marcin
	Implemented status-get command which returns general status
	information about a Kea server status and optionally
	HA specific information if the HA hooks library is present.
	(Gitlab #1041)

1698.	[doc]		wlodek
	Avalanche scenario for perfdhcp is now documented.
	(Gitlab #876)

1697.	[doc]		wlodek
	Forensic logging documentation now mentions database
	configuration.
	(Gitlab #943)

1696.	[func]		fdupont
	A new hook library libdhcp_bootp has been implemented. Once
	loaded, this hook will provide support for BOOTP packets, as
	defined in RFC1497. Please see the "BOOTP support" Section in the
	ARM for details.
	(Gitlab #898)

1695.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support of BOOTP leases with infinite valid lifetime.
	This includes representation of such leases in MySQL and
	PostgreSQL databases which the expire date can be a 32 bit
	integer.
	(Gitlab #897)

1694.	[doc]		marcin
	Described the usage of the ha-heartbeat command to check the
	states of the HA enabled DHCP servers.
	(Gitlab #998)

	Google test version detection improved.
	(Gitlab #206)

1690.	[func]		fdupont, razvan
	As a preparation for upcoming multi-threading, the PgSQL
	connection pool has been implemented. This code is not
	usable on its own yet, but it will allow all threads
	to share a pool of connections in the future. This
	should improve the overall PgSQL lease backend performance.
	Fixed some log messages that were missing lease type details
	in DHCPv6 PostgreSQL lease manager actions.
	(Gitlab #1044)

Kea 1.7.2 (development) released on Nov 27, 2019

1689.	[bug]*		fdupont
	The default Kea Control Agent's configuration file uses port 8000
	instead of 8080 for the agent. This corrects the mismatch between
	the default port number used by the kea-shell and the agent.
	(Gitlab #793)

1688.	[func]		fdupont
	Added a new callout (hook point) executed when the server has
	completed a configuration update using the Config Backend.
	(Gitlab #596)

1687.	[doc]		fdupont
	Described for developers the way for a hook library to be loadable
	only for specific server(s) and applied as an example to ha.
	(Gitlab #50)

1686.	[func]		razvan
	Added a generic ThreadPool class which can be used to process
	functor work items in parallel, on multiple threads. It uses
	a queue container to manage the work items.
	(Gitlab #883)

1685.	[build]		fdupont
	Small build improvement. The fcntl.h header is included in more
	portable way. This should make it easier to build on Alpine systems and
	possibly other systems.
	(Gitlab #765)

1684.	[func]		fdupont
	As a preparation for upcoming multi-threading, the MySQL
	connection pool has been implemented. This code is not
	usable on its own yet, but it will allow all threads
	to share a pool of connections in the future. This
	should improve the overall MySQL lease backend performance.
	(Gitlab #960)

1683.	[bug]		wlodek
	Perfdhcp is able to parse incoming packet and determine
	if included IA_NA/IA_PD options are correct, counter
	of rejected leases is introduced for all DHCP v6 message
	exchanges. Perfdhcp will no longer send Request/Renew/Release
	message without proper IA_NA/IA_PD included.
	(Gitlab #572)

1682.	[bug]*		tmark
	Added logic to core code and HA hook lib to allow HA peers
	to detect and handle out of bandwidth socket events.  This
	corrects a defect introduced in Kea 1.6.0 that can cause
	an HA server to become unresponsive when an HA socket has
	been closed by a peer.  Note that there is a change to the
	signature of the external socket callback handler invoked
	by IfaceMgr.  Custome hook libraries happen register external
	sockets with IfaceMgr will require modification and
	recompilation.
	(Gitlab #964)

Kea 1.7.1 (development) released on Oct 30, 2019

1681.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new command config-backend-pull which forces the server
	to immediately poll the configuration updates from the
	configuration backend
	(Gitlab #904)

	A bug in Makefile has been fixed. The changes made to
	src/lib/dhcpsrv/alloc_engine_messages.mes are now picked up
	properly.
	(Gitlab #752)

1679.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new commands to the lease_cmds hooks library to search for
	leases by hardware address, client-id, DUID and hostname. Now
	hostnames are stored in lower case within the lease database.
	(Gitlab #393)

1678.	[build]		fdupont
	The arguments passed to configure are now stored and are available
	using -W command line option.
	(Gitlab #869)

	Sample configs now all use the same paths for control sockets.
	(Gitlab #795)

1676.	[func]		fdupont
	A new hook - flex-option - has been developed. It allows setting
	up DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option values dynamically, using expression.
	This capability is very useful when you want to generate option

	Fixed a bug introduced in Kea 1.6.0 (see #539) that caused
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 to discard inbound packets containing
	string options that consist solely of nulls.  The servers
	will now quietly omit empty or all-null string options from
	inbound packets.
	(Gitlab #900,!561, git c75a7c10bde74f59d481a7717b4e03b9cb2268a6)

	DHCPv6 server avoids collisions between prefixes that are allocated
	as a result of receiving hints from the clients. Previously the
	whole prefix (including bits beyond the prefix length) was used to

	respectively. This facility can be used to do a DNS or DHCP-only
	build of BIND 10. DNS and DHCP components are both enabled by
	default.

	While not all tests still pass, main BIND 10 programs should
	generally work correctly.  Still, there can be odd run time
	behavior such as abrupt crash instead of graceful shutdown
	when some fatal event happens, so it's generally discouraged to
	use BIND 10 on FreeBSD 9.1 RELEASE.  According to the above
	bug report for FreeBSD, it seems upgrading or downgrading the

	There is no longer a default user account. The old default account
	with username 'root' has been removed. In a fresh installation of
	BIND 10, the administrator has to configure a user account using
	the b10-cmdctl-usermgr program.

	libdatasrc/b10-auth: corrected some corner cases in query handling
	of in-memory data source that led to the following invalid/odd

	functionality the new version should be generally backwards
	compatible to the old version, but there are some
	incompatibilities: name fields of RDATA (in NS, SOA, etc) must
	be absolute for now; due to the stricter checks some input that was
	(incorrectly) accepted by the old version may now be rejected;
	command line options and arguments are not compatible.

	Configuration of TSIG keys for b10-xfrin has changed; instead of
	specifying the full TSIG key (<name>:<base64>:<algo>) it now expects
	just the name, and uses the global TSIG Key Ring like all the other
	components (configuration list /tsig_keys/keys).
	Note: this is not automatically updated, so if you use TSIG in
	xfrin, you need to update your configuration.

	Note that there are still a few instances where output is printed,
	these shall be addressed separately.
	Note also that, currently, in case it falls back to stdout (such as
	when it cannot connect to b10-cfgmgr), all log messages are always
	printed (including debug messages), regardless of whether -v was
	used. This shall also be addressed in a future change.

	the reconfiguration doesn't block query handling.
	(Multiple Trac tickets up to #2211)

494.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a problem that shutting down BIND 10 kept some of the
	processes alive.  It was two-fold: when the main bind10 process
	started as a root, started b10-sockcreator with the privilege, and
	then dropped the privilege, the bind10 process cannot kill the
	sockcreator via signal any more (when it has to), but it kept
	sending the signal and didn't stop.  Also, when running on Python
	3.1 (or older), the sockcreator had some additional file
	descriptor open, which prevented it from exiting even after the
	bind10 process terminated.  Now the bind10 process simply gives up
	killing a subprocess if it fails due to lack of permission, and it
	makes sure the socket creator is spawned without any unnecessary
	FDs open.

	Memory footprint of the in-memory data source has been
	substantially improved.  For example, b10-auth now requires much
	less memory than BIND 9 named for loading and serving the same
	zone in-memory.  This is a transparent change in terms of user
	operation; there's no need to update or change the configuration
	to enable this feature.
	Notes: multiple instances of b10-auth still make separate copies
	of the memory image.  Also, loading zones in memory still suspends
	query processing, so manual reloading or reloading after incoming
	transfer may cause service disruption for huge zones.

	Allow bindctl to add and remove items to and from lists
	and dicts for items of type "any". This is for easier
	configurations.

	libdns++: The LabelSequence class has been extended with some new
	methods.  These are mainly intended for internal development, but
	the class is public, so interested users may want to look into the

	BIND 10 now compiles against googletest-1.6.0 versions that are
	installed on the system as source code. For such versions, use the
	--with-gtest-source configure switch.

461.	[bug]		muks
	We now set g+w and g+s permissions (mode 02770) during
	installation for the BIND 10 local state directory
	($prefix/var/bind10-devel/) so that permissions to files
	and sub-directories created in that directory are inherited.
	(Trac #2171, git ab4d20907abdb3ce972172463dcc73405b3dee79)

460.	[bug]		muks
	SSHFP's algorithm and fingerprint type checks have been relaxed
	such that they will accept any values in [0,255]. This is so that
	future algorithm and fingerprint types are accommodated.

	b10-dhcp6: DHCPv6 server component is now integrated into
	BIND 10 framework. It can be started from BIND 10 (using bindctl)

458.	[build]*		jinmei
	BIND 10 now relies on Boost offset_ptr, which caused some new
	portability issues.  Such issues are detected at ./configure time.
	If ./configure stops due to this, try the following workaround:
	- If it's about the use of mutable for a reference with clang++,
	  upgrade Boost version to 1.44 or higher, or try a different
	  compiler (e.g. g++ generally seems to be free from this issue)
	- If it's about the use of "variadic templates", specify
	  --without-werror so the warning won't be promoted to an error.
	  Specifying BOOST_NO_USER_CONFIG in CXXFLAGS may also work
	  (which would be the case if Boost is installed via pkgsrc)
	(Trac #2147, git 30061d1139aad8716e97d6b620c259752fd0a3cd)

457.	[build]*		muks
	BIND 10 library names now have a "b10-" prefix. This is to avoid
	clashes with other similarly named libraries on the system.
	(Trac #2071, git ac20a00c28069804edc0a36050995df52f601efb)

456.	[build]		muks
	BIND 10 now compiles against log4cplus-1.1.0 (RC releases)
	also.  Note: some older versions of log4cplus don't work any more;
	known oldest workable version is 1.0.4.  Thanks to John Lumby for
	sending a patch.
	(Trac #2169, git 7d7e5269d57451191c0aef1b127d292d3615fe2c)

455.	[func]*		vorner
	The server now uses newer API for data sources. This would be an
	internal change, however, the data sources are now configured
	differently. Please, migrate your configuration to the top-level
	"data_sources" module.  Also the bind10 -n and --no-cache
	and b10-auth -n options are removed.
	(Trac #1976, git 0d4685b3e7603585afde1b587cbfefdfaf6a1bb3)

454.	[bug]		jelte
	b10-cfgmgr now loads its configuration check plugins directly from
	the plugin search path, as opposed to importing them from the
	general python system module path list; this prevents naming
	conflicts with real python modules.
	(Trac #2119, git 2f68d7ac5c3c7cc88a3663191113eece32d46a3d)

453.	[bug]		jelte
	b10-auth no longer tries to send DDNS UPDATE messages to b10-ddns if
	b10-ddns is not running. Sending an UPDATE to BIND 10 that is not
	configured to run DDNS will now result in a response with rcode
	NOTIMP instead of SERVFAIL.

452.	[func]		muks, jelte
	isc-sysinfo: An initial implementation of the isc-sysinfo
	tool is now available for Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Mac
	OS X. It gathers and outputs system information which can
	be used by future tech support staff. This includes a
	generic Python "sysinfo" module.

451.	[bug]		muks, jinmei
	libdatasrc: the database-based data source now correctly returns
	glue records on (not under) a zone cut, such as in the case where
	the NS name of an NS record is identical to its owner name. (Note:
	libdatasrc itself doesn't judge what kind of record type can be a
	"glue"; it's the caller's responsibility.)

449.	[bug]		muks
	b10-xfin: fixed a bug where xfrin sent the wrong notification
	message to zonemgr on successful zone transfer. This also
	solves other reported problems such as too frequent attempts
	of zone refreshing (see Trac #1786 and #1834).
	(Trac #2023, git b5fbf8a408a047a2552e89ef435a609f5df58d8c)

448.	[func]		team
	b10-ddns is now functional and handles dynamic update requests
	per RFC 2136.  See BIND 10 guide for configuration and operation
	details.
	(Multiple Trac tickets)

447.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in b10-xfrout where a helper thread could fall into
	an infinite loop if b10-auth stops while the thread is waiting for
	forwarded requests from b10-auth.
	(Trac #988 and #1833, git 95a03bbefb559615f3f6e529d408b749964d390a)

446.	[bug]		muks
	A number of warnings reported by Python about unclosed file and
	socket objects were fixed. Some related code was also made safer.

445.	[bug]*		jinmei
	The pre-install check for older SQLite3 DB now refers to the DB
	file with the prefix of DESTDIR.  This ensures that 'make install'
	with specific DESTDIR works regardless of the version of the DB
	file installed in the default path.
	(Trac #1982, git 380b3e8ec02ef45555c0113ee19329fe80539f71)

444.	[bug]		jinmei
	libdatasrc: fixed ZoneFinder for database-based data sources so
	that it handles type DS query correctly, i.e., treating it as
	authoritative data even on a delegation point.
	(Trac #1912, git 7130da883f823ce837c10cbf6e216a15e1996e5d)

443.	[func]*		muks
	The logger now uses a lockfile named `logger_lockfile' that is
	created in the local state directory to mutually separate
	individual logging operations from various processes. This is
	done so that log messages from different processes don't mix
	together in the middle of lines. The `logger_lockfile` is created
	with file permission mode 0660. BIND 10's local state directory
	should be writable and perhaps have g+s mode bit so that the
	`logger_lockfile` can be opened by a group of processes.

429.	[func]		jelte
	Added an 'execute' component to bindctl, which executes either a set
	of commands from a file or a built-in set of commands. Currently,
	only 'init_authoritative_server' is provided as a built-in set, but
	it is expected that more will be added later.

	libdatasrc, b10-xfrin: the zone updater for database-based data
	sources now correctly distinguishes NSEC3-related RRs (NSEC3 and
	NSEC3-covering RRSIG) from others, and the SQLite3 implementation
	now manipulates them in the separate table for the NSEC3 namespace.
	As a result b10-xfrin now correctly updates NSEC3-signed zones by

421.	[build]		jinmei
	Made sure BIND 10 can be built with clang++ 3.1.  (It failed on
	MacOS 10.7 using Xcode 4.3, but it's more likely to be a matter of

420.	[bug]*		jinmei, stephen
	Updated the DB schema used in the SQLite3 data source so it can
	use SQL indices more effectively.  The previous schema had several
	issues in this sense and could be very slow for some queries on a
	very large zone (especially for negative answers).  This change
	requires a major version up of the schema; use b10-dbutil to
	upgrade existing database files.  Note: 'make install' will fail
	unless old DB files installed in the standard location have been
	upgraded.

413.	[func]		stephen, jelte
	Created a new tool b10-dbutil, that can check and upgrade database
	schemas, to be used when incompatible changes are introduced in the
	backend database schema. Currently it only supports sqlite3 databases.
	Note: there's no schema change that requires this utility as of
	the March 29th release.  While running it shouldn't break
	an existing database file, it should be even more advisable not to
	run it at the moment.
	(Trac #963, git 49ba2cf8ac63246f389ab5e8ea3b3d081dba9adf)

412.	[func]		jelte
	Added a command-line option '--clear-config' to bind10, which causes
	the system to create a backup of the existing configuration database
	file, and start out with a clean default configuration. This can be
	used if the configuration file is corrupted to the point where it
	cannot be read anymore, and BIND 10 refuses to start. The name of
	the backup file can be found in the logs (CFGMGR_RENAMED_CONFIG_FILE).

410.	[bug]		jinmei
	Python CC library now ensures write operations transmit all given
	data (unless an error happens).  Previously it didn't check the
	size of transmitted data, which could result in partial write on
	some systems (notably on OpenBSD) and subsequently cause system
	hang up or other broken state.  This fix specifically solves start
	up failure on OpenBSD.

	The DataSourceClientContainer class that dynamically loads
	datasource backend libraries no longer provides just a .so file name
	to its call to dlopen(), but passes it an absolute path. This means
	that it is no longer an system implementation detail that depends on
	[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH which file is chosen, should there be multiple
	options (for instance, when test-running a new build while a
	different version is installed).
	These loadable libraries are also no longer installed in the default
	library path, but in a subdirectory of the libexec directory of the
	target ($prefix/libexec/[version]/backends).
	This also removes the need to handle b10-xfin and b10-xfrout as

	components as dictated by the configuration of the boss process.

	b10-resolver: Introduced ACL on incoming queries.  By default the
	resolver accepts queries from ::1 and 127.0.0.1 and rejects all
	others.  The ACL can be configured with bindctl via the
	"Resolver/query_acl" parameter.  For example, to accept queries
	from 192.0.2.0/24 (in addition to the default list), do this:
	> config add Resolver/query_acl
	> config set Resolver/query_acl[2]/action "ACCEPT"

	Resolved that the stats module wasn't configurable in bindctl in
	spite of its having configuration items. The configuration part
	was removed from the original spec file "stats.spec" and was
	placed in a new spec file "stats-schema.spec". Because it means
	definitions of statistics items. The command part is still
	there. Thus stats module currently has no its own configuration,
	and the items in "stats-schema.spec" are neither visible nor
	configurable through bindctl. "stats-schema.spec" is shared with
	stats module and stats-httpd module, and maybe with other
	statistical modules in future. "stats.spec" has own configuration
	and commands of stats module, if it requires.

213.	[bug]		naokikambe
	Solved incorrect datetime of "bind10.boot_time" and also
	added a new command "sendstats" for Bob. This command is
	to send statistics data to the stats daemon immediately.
	The solved problem is that statistics data doesn't surely
	reach to the daemon because Bob sent statistics data to
	the daemon while it is starting. So the daemon invokes the
	command for Bob after it starts up. This command is also
	useful for resending statistics data via bindctl manually.

204.	[bug]		jinmei
	b10-auth, src/lib/datasrc: class ANY queries were not handled
	correctly in the generic data source (mainly for sqlite3).  It
	could crash b10-auth in the worst case, and could result in
	incorrect responses in some other cases.

202.	[func]		vorner
	It is possible to specify a different directory where we look for

	Imported system test framework of BIND 9.  It can be run by
	'make systest' at the top source directory.  Notes: currently it
	doesn't work when built in a separate tree.  It also requires
	perl, an inherited dependency from the original framework.
	Also, mainly for the purpose of tests, a new option "--pid-file"
	was added to BoB, with which the boss process will dump its PID

184.	[func]*		vorner
	Listening address and port configuration of b10-auth is the same as

182.	[func]		jinmei
	Support cppcheck for static code check on C++ code.  If cppcheck
	is available, 'make cppcheck' on the top source directory will run
	the checker and should cleanly complete with an exit code of 0

	src/lib/dns: revised dnssectime functions so that they don't rely
	on the time_t type (whose size varies on different systems, which
	can lead to subtle bugs like some form of "year 2038 problem").
	Also handled 32-bit wrap around issues more explicitly, with more
	detailed tests.  The function API has been changed, but the effect
	should be minimal because these functions are mostly private.

	b10-auth, src/lib/datasrc: in memory data source now works as a

163.	[func]		vorner
	The pimpl design pattern is used in UDPServer, with a shared
	pointer. This makes it smaller to copy (which is done a lot as a
	side effect of being coroutine) and speeds applications of this

162.	[func]		stephen
	Added C++ logging, allowing logging at different severities.
	Code specifies the message to be logged via a symbol, and the
	logging code picks up the message from an in-built dictionary.
	The contents of the dictionary can be replaced at run-time by
	locale-specific messages.  A message compiler program is provided
	to create message header files and supply the default messages.
	(Trac #438, git 7b1606cea7af15dc71f5ec1d70d958b00aa98af7)

160.	[func]		jelte
	Updated the resolver to take 3 different timeout values;
	timeout_query for outstanding queries we sent while resolving
	timeout_client for sending an answer back to the client
	timeout_lookup for stopping the resolving
	(currently 2 and 3 have the same final effect)

	(Trac #483, git a07e078b4feeb01949133fc88c9939254c38aa7c)

158.	[func]		jelte
	The Resolver module will now do (very limited) resolving, if not
	set to forwarding mode (i.e. if the configuration option
	forward_addresses is left empty). It only supports referrals that
	contain glue addresses at this point, and does no other processing
	of authoritative answers.

	b10-auth: Added new configuration variable "statistics-interval"
	to allow the user to change the timer interval for periodic
	statistics updates.  The update can also be disabled by setting

	b10-cfgmgr: No longer save the configuration on exit. Configuration
	is already saved if it is changed successfully, so writing it on

	bindctl: Check if the user session has disappeared (either by a
	timeout or by a server restart), and reauthenticate if so. This
	fixes the 'cmdctl not running' problem.
	(Trac #431, git b929be82fec5f92e115d8985552f84b4fdd385b9)

148.	[func]		jelte
	bindctl: Command results are now pretty-printed (i.e. printed in
	a more readable form). Empty results are no longer printed at all
	(used to print '{}'), and the message
	'send the command to cmd-ctrl' has also been removed.
	(git 3954c628c13ec90722a2d8816f52a380e0065bae)

	python/isc/config: Fixed a bug that importing custom configuration
	(in b10-config.db) of a remote module didn't work.
	(Trac #478, git ea4a481003d80caf2bff8d0187790efd526d72ca)

146.	[func]		jelte
	Command arguments were not validated internally against their
	specifications. This change fixes that (on the C++ side, Python
	side depends on an as yet planned addition). Note: this is only
	an added internal check, the cli already checks format.
	(Trac #473, git 5474eba181cb2fdd80e2b2200e072cd0a13a4e52)

145.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a new command 'loadzone' for (re)loading a
	specific zone.  The command syntax is generic but it is currently
	only feasible for class IN in memory data source.  To reload a
	zone "example.com" via bindctl, execute the command as follows:
	> Auth loadzone origin = example.com
	(Trac #467 git 4f7e1f46da1046de527ab129a88f6aad3dba7562
	from 1d7d3918661ba1c6a8b1e40d8fcbc5640a84df12)

144.	[build]		jinmei
	Introduced a workaround for clang++ build on FreeBSD (and probably
	some other OSes).  If building BIND 10 fails with clang++ due to
	a link error about "__dso_handle", try again from the configure
	script with CXX_LIBTOOL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib (the path actually
	doesn't matter; the important part is the -L flag).  This
	workaround is not automatically enabled as it's difficult to
	detect the need for it dynamically, and must be enabled via the
	variable by hand.
	(Trac #474, git cfde436fbd7ddf3f49cbbd153999656e8ca2a298)

143.	[build]		jinmei
	Fixed build problems with clang++ in unit tests due to recent
	changes.  No behavior change. (Trac #448, svn r4133)

142.	[func]		jinmei
	b10-auth: updated query benchmark so that it can test in memory
	data source.  Also fixed a bug that the output buffer isn't
	cleared after query processing, resulting in misleading results
	or program crash.  This is a regression due to change #135.
	(Trac #465, svn r4103)

141.	[bug]		jinmei
	b10-auth: Fixed a bug that the authoritative server includes
	trailing garbage data in responses.  This is a regression due to
	change #135. (Trac #462, svn r4081)

140.	[func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:
	  ... "auth.queries.tcp": 1, "auth.queries.udp": 1 ...
	Using the "Auth sendstats" command you can make b10-auth send the
	counters to b10-stats immediately.
	(Trac #347, svn r4026)

139.	[build]		jreed
	Introduced configure option and make targets for generating
	Python code coverage report. This adds new make targets:
	report-python-coverage and clean-python-coverage. The C++
	code coverage targets were renamed to clean-cpp-coverage
	and report-cpp-coverage. (Trac #362, svn r4023)

138.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a configuration interface to support in memory
	data sources.  For example, the following command to bindctl
	will configure a memory data source containing the "example.com"
	zone with the zone file named "example.com.zone":
	> config set Auth/datasources/ [{"type": "memory", "zones": \
	 [{"origin": "example.com", "file": "example.com.zone"}]}]
	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be
	configured explicitly.  To disable it again, specify a null list
	for Auth/datasources:
	> config set Auth/datasources/ []
	Notes: it's currently for class IN only.  The zone files are not
	actually loaded into memory yet (which will soon be implemented).
	This is an experimental feature and the syntax may change in
	future versions.

	Fix run_*.sh scripts that are used for development testing
	so they use a msgq socket file in the build tree.
	(Trac #226, svn r3989)

136.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl (and the configuration manager in general) now no longer
	accepts 'unknown' data; i.e. data for modules that it does not know
	about, or configuration items that are not specified in the .spec
	files.
	(Trac #202, svn r3967)

	b10-resolver supports timeouts and retries in forwarder mode.
	(Trac #401, svn r3660)

	New temporary logging function available in isc::log. It is used by
	b10-resolver.
	(Trac #393, r3602)

132.	[func]		vorner
	The b10-resolver is configured through config manager.
	It has "listen_on" and "forward_addresses" options.
	(Trac #389, r3448)

131.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced two template classes RBTree and RBNode
	to provide the generic map with domain name as key and anything as
	the value. Because of some unresolved design issue, the new classes
	are only intended to be used by memory zone and zone table.
	(Trac #397, svn r3890)

130.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced a new class MemoryDataSrc to provide
	the general interface for memory data source.  For the initial
	implementation, we don't make it a derived class of AbstractDataSrc
	because the interface is so different (we'll eventually
	consider this as part of the generalization work).
	(Trac #422, svn r3866)

129.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added new functions masterLoad() for loading master
	zone files.  The initial implementation can only parse a limited
	form of master files, but BIND 9's named-compilezone can convert
	any valid zone file into the acceptable form.
	(Trac #423, svn r3857)

128.	[build]		vorner
	Test for query name = '.', type = DS to authoritative nameserver

bind10-devel-20101201 released on December 01, 2010

125.	[func]		jelte
	Added support for addressing individual list items in bindctl
	configuration commands; If you have an element that is a list, you
	can use foo[X]		integer
	(starting at 0)
	(Trac #405, svn r3739)

124.	[bug]		jreed
	Fix some wrong version reporting. Now also show the version
	for the component and BIND 10 suite. (Trac #302, svn r3696)

123.	[bug]		jelte
	src/bin/bindctl printed values had the form of python literals
	(e.g. 'True'), while the input requires valid JSON (e.g. 'true').
	Output changed to JSON format for consistency. (svn r3694)

122.	[func]		stephen
	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

121.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is
	not much of real use, however, because no protocol support was
	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

120.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

117.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the
	support of in memory data source.  This is an intermediate step to
	the bigger feature, and is not yet actually usable in practice.
	(Trac #399, svn r3590)

116.	[bug]		jerry
	src/bin/xfrout: Xfrout and Auth will communicate by long tcp
	connection, Auth needs to make a new connection only on the first
	time or if an error occurred.
	(Trac #299, svn r3482)

115.	[func]*		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Changed DNS message flags and section names from

	type safety and usability.  API has been changed accordingly.
	More documentation and tests were provided with these changes.
	(Trac #358, r3439)

	Folder name 'utils'(the folder in /src/lib/python/isc/) has been
	renamed	to 'util'. Programs that used 'import isc.utils.process'
	now need to use 'import isc.util.process'. The folder
	/src/lib/python/isc/Util is removed since it isn't used by any
	program. (Trac #364, r3382)

112.	[func]		zhang likun
	Add one mixin class to override the naive serve_forever() provided

	every poll_interval seconds, one socketpair is used to wake up
	the waiting server. (Trac #352, svn r3366)

111.	[bug]*		Vaner
	Make sure process xfrin/xfrout/zonemgr/cmdctl can be stopped

	NotifyOut.dispatcher spawn a thread themselves.
	(Trac #335, svn r3273)

110.	[func]		Vaner
	Added isc.net.check module to check ip addresses and ports for
	correctness and isc.net.addr to hold IP address. The bind10, xfrin

	(Trac #353, svn r3240)

109.	[func]		naokikambe
	Added the initial version of the stats module for the statistics
	feature of BIND 10, which supports the restricted features and

	Disable threads in ASIO to minimize build time dependency.
	(Trac #345, r3100)

101.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Completed Opcode and Rcode implementation with more
	tests and documentation.  API is mostly the same but the
	validation was a bit tightened. (Trac #351, svn r3056)

100.	[func]		Vaner
	Python processes: support naming of python processes so
	they're not all called python3.
	(Trac #322, svn r3052)

99.	[func]*		jinmei
	Introduced a separate EDNS class to encapsulate EDNS related

	although it won't affect most of higher level applications.
	(Trac #311, svn r3020)

98.	[build]		jinmei
	The ./configure script now tries to search some common include
	paths for boost header files to minimize the need for explicit

97.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a micro benchmark test for query processing of b10-auth.
	(Trac #308, svn r2982)

	bin/xfrout and bin/zonemgr: Fixed some stderr output.
	(Trac #341, svn r2951)

94.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/xfrout:  Fixed a problem in xfrout where only 2 or 3 RRs
	were used per DNS message in the xfrout stream.
	(Trac #334, r2931)

93.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: A DS query could crash the library (and therefore,
	e.g. the authoritative server) if some RR of the same apex name
	is stored in the hot spot cache. (Trac #307, svn r2923)

92.	[func]*		jelte
	libdns_python (the python wrappers for libdns++) has been renamed
	to pydnspp (Python DNS++). Programs and libraries that used
	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

88.	[func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

87.	[func]		zhanglikun
	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one
	of the co-operating processes of BIND 10, which keeps track of
	timers and other information necessary for BIND 10 to act as a
	slave. (Trac #215, svn r2737)

85.	[build]*		jinmei
	Build programs using dynamic link by default.  A new configure
	option --enable-static-link is provided to force static link for
	executable programs.  Statically linked programs can be run on a

	(Trac #309, svn r2723)

bind10-devel-20100812 released on August 12, 2010

84.	[bug]		jinmei, jerry
	This is a quick fix patch for the issue: AXFR fails half the

	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

83.	[build]*		jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

82.	[func]		jinmei
	bin/auth: Added -u option to change the effective process user
	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

81.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a C++ framework for micro benchmark tests.  A supplemental
	library functions to build query data for the tests were also
	provided. (Trac #241, svn r2664)

80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or
	non-running modules (for the latter, this is until we have a
	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's
	already running (listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

73.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

71.	[func]		each
	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

70.	[func]		each
	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

69.	[func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

68.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c (--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file',
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

67.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

66.	[bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)

65.	[func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

64.	[func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

63.	[func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

62.	[func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

61.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc, bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

56.	[func]*		jinmei

	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

55.	[bug]		shane

	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Trac #136, svn r2147)

54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(),
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process,
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't
	be removed, exit from python.
	(Trac #151, svn r2091)

	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

48.	[func]		jelte
	bin/auth: Use asio's io_service for the msgq handling.
	(svn r2007)

38.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.
	Remove unused socket file when Xfrout process exits. Make sure Xfrout
	exit by itself when it receives SIGINT, instead of being killed by the
	signal SIGTERM or SIGKILL sent from boss.
	(Trac #135, #151, #134, svn r1797)

37.	[build]		jinmei
	Check for the availability of python-config. (Trac #159,

	bin/auth: output now prepended with "[b10-auth]" (Trac
	#109, svn r1985)

32.	[func]*		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
	boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
	headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
	using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)

31.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)

30.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,
	and invalid parameters could cause integer overflow and make the
	library crash. (Trac #177, svn r1806)

LEGEND
[bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func]  new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	security patch releases.
[perf]  Performance related change.

*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

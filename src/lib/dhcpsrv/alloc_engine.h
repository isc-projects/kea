    ///   client, the existing lease is replaced with a new lease.

    ///   to allocate a new lease. If the client has a reservation for the
    ///   particular address or if it has specified a desired address the
    ///   server will check if the particular address is not allocated to
    ///   another client. If the address is available, the server will allocate
    ///   this address for the client.
    /// - If the desired address is unavailable the server checks if the
    ///   lease for this address has expired. If the lease is expired, the
    ///   server will allocate this lease to the client. The relevant
    ///   information will be updated, e.g. new client HW address, host name
    ///   etc.
    /// - If the desired address is in use by another client, the server will
    ///   try to allocate a different address. The server picks addresses from
    ///   a dynamic pool and checks if the address is available and that
    ///   it is not reserved for another client. If it is in use by another
    ///   client or if it is reserved for another client, the address is not
    ///   allocated. The server picks the next address and repeats this check.
    ///   Note that the server ceases allocation after the configured number
    ///   of unsuccessful attempts.
    ///
    /// The lease allocation process is slightly different for the
    /// DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPREQUEST messages. In the former case, the client
    /// may specify the requested IP address option with a desired address and
    /// the server treats this address as a hint. This means that the server may
    /// allocate a different address at its discretion and send it to the
    /// client in the DHCPOFFER. If the client accepts this offer it specifies
    /// this address in the requested IP address option in the DHCPREQUEST.
    /// At this point, the allocation engine will use the requested IP address
    /// as a hard requirement and if this address can't be allocated for
    /// any reason, the allocation engine returns NULL lease. As a result,
    /// the DHCP server sends a DHCPNAK to the client and the client
    /// falls back to the DHCP server discovery.
    ///
    /// The only exception from this rule is when the client doesn't specify
    /// a requested IP address option (invalid behavior) in which case the
    /// allocation engine will try to allocate any address.
    ///
    /// If there is an address reservation specified for the particular client
    /// the reserved address always takes precedence over addresses from the
    /// dynamic pool or even an address currently allocated for this client.
    ///
    /// It is possible that the address reserved for the particular client
    /// is in use by another client, e.g. as a result of pools reconfiguration.
    /// In this case, when the client requests allocation of the reserved
    /// address and the server determines that it is leased to someone else,
    /// the allocation engine allocates a different address for this client.
    ///
    /// When the client having a lease returns to renew, the allocation engine
    /// doesn't extend the lease for it and returns a NULL pointer. The client
    /// falls back to the 4-way exchange and a different lease is allocated.
    /// At this point, the reserved address is freed and can be allocated to

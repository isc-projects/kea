% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTED control channel session started on socket %1
A debug message issued during startup after the IPv4 DHCP server has
successfully established a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTING starting control channel session, specfile: %1
This debug message is issued just before the IPv4 DHCP server attempts
to establish a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_COMMAND_RECEIVED received command %1, arguments: %2
A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND 10 control system by the IPv4 DHCP server.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_COMPLETE DHCPv4 server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. it is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL failed to load configuration: %1
This critical error message indicates that the initial DHCPv4
configuration has failed. The server will start, but nothing will be
served until the configuration has been corrected.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_NEW_SUBNET A new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified IPv4 subnet.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_START DHCPv4 server is processing the following configuration: %1
This is a debug message that is issued every time the server receives a
configuration. That happens at start up and also when a server configuration
change is committed by the administrator.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_UPDATE updated configuration received: %1
A debug message indicating that the IPv4 DHCP server has received an
updated configuration from the BIND 10 configuration system.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_OPTION_DUPLICATE multiple options with the code: %1 added to the subnet: %2
This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options with the
same option code for the particular subnet. Adding multiple options is uncommon
for DHCPv4, but it is not prohibited.

% DHCP4_NOT_RUNNING IPv4 DHCP server is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
IPv4 DHCP server but it is not running.

% DHCP4_OPEN_SOCKET opening sockets on port %1
A debug message issued during startup, this indicates that the IPv4 DHCP
server is about to open sockets on the specified port.

% DHCP4_PACKET_PARSE_FAIL failed to parse incoming packet: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server has received a packet that it is unable to
interpret. The reason why the packet is invalid is included in the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVED %1 (type %2) packet received on interface %3
A debug message noting that the server has received the specified type of
packet on the specified interface.  Note that a packet marked as UNKNOWN
may well be a valid DHCP packet, just a type not expected by the server
(e.g. it will report a received OFFER packet as UNKNOWN).

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVE_FAIL error on attempt to receive packet: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server tried to receive a packet but an error
occurred during this attempt. The reason for the error is included in
the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_SEND_FAIL failed to send DHCPv4 packet: %1
This error is output if the IPv4 DHCP server fails to send an assembled
DHCP message to a client. The reason for the error is included in the
message.

% DHCP4_PACK_FAIL failed to assemble response correctly
This error is output if the server failed to assemble the data to be
returned to the client into a valid packet.  The cause is most likely
to be a programming error: please raise a bug report.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_EXCEPTION parser failed to commit changes
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv4 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but one
of them failed to commit its changes due to a low-level system exception
being raised.  Additional messages may be output indicating the reason.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_FAIL parser failed to commit changes: %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv4 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but
one of them failed to commit its changes.  The reason for the failure
is given in the message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATED1 created parser for configuration element %1
A debug message output during a configuration update of the IPv4 DHCP
server, notifying that the parser for the specified configuration element
has been successfully created in the first pass through creating parsers

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATED2 created parser for configuration element %1
A debug message output during a configuration update of the IPv4 DHCP
server, notifying that the parser for the specified configuration element
has been successfully created in the second pass through creating parsers

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATE_FAIL failed to create parser for configuration element %1: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv4 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of the
named configuration element.  The reason for the failure is given in the
message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATE_EXCEPTION failed to create parser for configuration element %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv4 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents
of the named configuration element.  The message has been output in
response to a non-BIND 10 exception being raised.  Additional messages
may give further information.

% DHCP4_QUERY_DATA received packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data received from the client.

% DHCP4_RESPONSE_DATA responding with packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data returned to the client.

% DHCP4_SERVER_FAILED server failed: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server has encountered a fatal error and is terminating.
The reason for the failure is included in the message.

% DHCP4_SESSION_FAIL failed to establish BIND 10 session (%1), running stand-alone
The server has failed to establish communication with the rest of BIND
10 and is running in stand-alone mode.  (This behavior will change once
the IPv4 DHCP server is properly integrated with the rest of BIND 10.)

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN server shutdown
The IPv4 DHCP server has terminated normally.

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST shutdown of server requested
This debug message indicates that a shutdown of the IPv4 server has
been requested via a call to the 'shutdown' method of the core Dhcpv4Srv
object.

% DHCP4_SRV_CONSTRUCT_ERROR error creating Dhcpv4Srv object, reason: %1
This error message indicates that during startup, the construction of a
core component within the IPv4 DHCP server (the Dhcpv4 server object)
has failed.  As a result, the server will exit.  The reason for the
failure is given within the message.

% DHCP4_STANDALONE skipping message queue, running standalone
This is a debug message indicating that the IPv4 server is running in
standalone mode, not connected to the message queue.  Standalone mode
is only useful during program development, and should not be used in a
production environment.

% DHCP4_STARTING server starting
This informational message indicates that the IPv4 DHCP server has
processed any command-line switches and is starting.

% DHCP4_START_INFO pid: %1, port: %2, verbose: %3, standalone: %4
This is a debug message issued during the IPv4 DHCP server startup.
It lists some information about the parameters with which the server
is running.

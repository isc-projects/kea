/// The \c EDNS class represents the %EDNS OPT RR defined in RFC2671.
///
/// This class encapsulates various optional features of %EDNS such as
/// the UDP payload size or the DNSSEC DO bit, and provides interfaces
/// to manage these features.  It is also responsible for conversion
/// to and from wire-format OPT RR.
/// One important exception is about the extended RCODE:
/// The \c EDNS class is only responsible for extracting the 8-bit part
/// of the 12-bit extended RCODE from the OPT RR's TTL field of an
/// incoming message, and for setting the 8-bit part into the OPT RR TTL
/// of an outgoing message.  It's not supposed to know how to construct the
/// complete RCODE, much less maintain the RCODE in it.
/// It is the caller's responsibility (typically the \c Message class).
///
/// When converting wire-format OPT RR into an \c EDNS object, it normalizes
/// the information, i.e., unknown flags will be ignored on construction.
///
/// This class is also supposed to support %EDNS options such as NSID,
/// but the initial implementation does not include it.  This is a near term
/// TODO item.
///
/// <b>Notes to developers</b>
///
/// The rest of the description is for developers who need to or want to
/// understand the design of this API.
///
/// Representing %EDNS is tricky.  An OPT RR is no different from other RRs
/// in terms of the wire format syntax, and in that sense we could use the
/// generic \c RRset class to represent an OPT RR (BIND 9 adopts this
/// approach).  But the resulting interface would be inconvenient for
/// developers.  For example, the developer would need to know that the
/// UDP size is encoded in the RR Class field.  It's better to provide
/// a more abstract interface along with the special semantics of OPT RR.
///
/// Another approach would be to realize each optional feature of EDNS
/// as an attribute of the DNS message.
/// NLnet Labs' ldns takes this approach.
/// This way an operation for specifying the UDP size would be written
/// like this:
/// \code message->setUDPSize(4096); \endcode
/// which should be more intuitive.
/// A drawback of this approach is that OPT RR is itself optional and the
/// separate parameters may not necessarily indicate whether to include an
/// OPT RR per se.
/// For example, consider what should be done with this code:
/// \code message->setUDPSize(512); \endcode
/// Since the payload size of 512 is the default, it may mean the OPT RR
/// should be skipped.  But it might also mean the caller intentionally
/// (for some reason) wants to insert an OPT RR specifying the default UDP
/// size explicitly.
///
/// So, we use a separate class that encapsulates the EDNS semantics and
/// knows the mapping between the semantics and the wire format representation.
/// This way the interface can be semantics-based and is intuitive:
/// \code edns->setUDPSize(4096); \endcode
/// while we can explicitly specify whether to include an OPT RR by setting
/// (or not setting) an \c EDNS object in a message:
/// \code message->setEDNS(edns); // unless we do this OPT RR is skipped
/// \endcode
///
/// There is still a non trivial point: How to manage extended RCODEs.
/// An OPT RR encodes the upper 8 bits of extended 12-bit RCODE.
/// In general, it would be better to provide a unified interface to get
/// access to RCODEs whether or not they are traditional 4 bit codes or
/// extended ones that have non 0 upper bits.
/// However, since an OPT RR may not appear in a message the RCODE cannot be
/// maintained in the \c EDNS class.
/// But it would not be desirable to maintain the extended RCODEs completely
/// in the \c Message class, either, because we wanted to hide the mapping
/// between %EDNS semantics and its wire format representation within the
///  \c EDNS class; if we moved the responsibility about RCODEs to the
/// \c Message class, it would have to parse and render the upper 8 bits of
/// the RCODEs, dealing with wire representation of OPT RR.
/// This is suboptimal in the sense of encapsulation.
///
/// As a compromise, our decision is to separate the knowledge about the
/// relationship with RCODE from the knowledge about the wire format as
/// noted in the beginning of this description.
///
/// This decoupling is based on the observation that the extended RCODE
/// is a very special case where %EDNS only has partial information.
/// If a future version of the %EDNS protocol introduces further relationship
/// between the message and the %EDNS, we might reconsider the interface,
/// probably with higher abstraction.

    /// does not take the bare wire-format %data in the form of an
    /// \c InputBuffer object.  This is because parsing incoming EDNS is
    /// highly context dependent and it's not feasible to handle it in a
    /// completely polymorphic way.  For example, a DNS message parser would
    /// have to check an OPT RR appears at most once in the message, and if
    /// it appears it should be in the additional section.  So, the parser
    /// needs to have an explicit check to see if an RR is of type OPT, and
    /// then (if other conditions are met) construct a corresponding \c EDNS

    /// \c RRType, etc, and it makes more sense to pass them directly to the
    /// constructor.

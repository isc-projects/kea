///
/// This class is responsible for parsing the command-line and storing the
/// specified options.
///
/// Some of the options perform general control (like setting the address of the
/// nameserver under test, while the rest set values in the DNS message being
/// sent.  Each of the latter options can be specified as either:
///
/// - \c --option value
/// - \c --option value1-value2
///
/// Either way, two values are extracted the low value and the high value (in
/// the former case, both are the same).  The values are stored and can be
/// returned on request.
///
/// For simplicity, the class takes care of the --help and --version flags,
/// each of which will cause a message to be printed to stdout and the program
/// to terminate.

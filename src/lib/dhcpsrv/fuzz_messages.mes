% FUZZ_DATA_READ read %1 byte(s) from AFL via stdin
Logged at debug log level 50.
A debug message output to indicate how much data has been received from
the fuzzer via stdin

% FUZZ_INIT_COMPLETE fuzz initialization complete: interface %1, address %2, port %3, max loops %4
An informational message output when the fuzzing initialization function has
completed successfully. The parameters listed are those which must be/can be
set via environment variables.

% FUZZ_INIT_FAIL fuzz initialization failure, reason: %1
An error message reported if the fuzzing initialization failed.  The reason
for the failure is given in the message.

% FUZZ_READ_FAIL error reading input from fuzzer: %1
This error is reported if the read of data from the fuzzer (which is
received over stdin) fails, or if a read returns zero bytes.  If this
occurs, the thread will sleep for a short period before retrying the read.
The message includes the reason for the failure.

% FUZZ_SEND sent %1 byte(s) to the socket connected to the Kea interface
Logged at debug log level 50.
A debug message stating that the sendto() call in the main fuzzing function
has successfully completed and reporting the number of bytes sent.  This
call sends data received from AFL to the port on which Kea is listening.

% FUZZ_SEND_ERROR failed to send data to Kea input socket: %1
This error will be reported if the sendto() call in the fuzzing thread (which
sends data received from AFL to the socket on which Kea is listening) fails.
The reason for the failure is given in the message.  The fuzzing code will
attempt to continue from this, but it may cause the fuzzing process to fail.

% FUZZ_SHORT_SEND expected to send %1 bytes to Kea input socket but only sent %2
A warning message that is output if the sendto() call (used to send data
from the fuzzing thread to the main Kea processing) did not send as much
data as that read from AFL.  This may indicate a problem in the underlying
communications between the fuzzing thread and the main Kea processing.

% FUZZ_SOCKET_CREATE_FAIL failed to crease socket for use by fuzzing thread: %1
An error message output when the fuzzing code has failed to create a socket
through which is will copy data received on stdin from the AFL fuzzer to
the port on which Kea is listening.  The program will most likely hang if
this occurs.

/// @file lease_mgr.h
/// @brief An abstract API for lease database
///
/// This file contains declarations of Lease4, Lease6 and LeaseMgr classes.
/// They are essential components of the interface to any database backend.
/// Each concrete database backend (e.g. MySQL) will define a class derived
/// from LeaseMgr class.
///
/// Failover considerations:
/// There are no intermediate plans to implement DHCPv4 failover
/// (draft-ietf-dhc-failover-12.txt). Currently (Oct. 2012) the DHCPv6 failover
/// is being defined in DHC WG in IETF (draft-ietf-dhcpv6-failover-requirements,
/// draft-ietf-dhcpv6-failover-design), but the work is not advanced enough
/// for implementation plans yet. v4 failover requires additional parameters
/// to be kept with a lease. It is likely that v6 failover will require similar
/// fields. Such implementation will require database schema extension.
/// We have designed a way to expand/upgrade schemas during upgrades: a database
/// schema is versioned and sanity checks about required version will be done
/// upon start and/or upgrade. With this mechanism in place, we can add new
/// fields to the database. In particular we can use that capability to
/// introduce failover related fields.
///
/// However, there is another approach that can be reliably used to provide
/// failover, even without the actual failover protocol implemented. As the
/// first backend will use MySQL, we will be able to use Multi-Master capability
/// offered by MySQL and use two separatate Kea instances connecting to the
/// same database.
///
/// Nevertheless, we hope to have failover protocol eventually implemented in
/// the Kea.

/// and call the appropriate functions, e.g. @c poll_one or @c run_one in a
/// main loop.

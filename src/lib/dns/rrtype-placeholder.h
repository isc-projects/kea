/// The \c RRType class encapsulates DNS resource record types.
///
/// This class manages the 16-bit integer type codes in quite a straightforward
/// way.  The only non trivial task is to handle textual representations of
/// RR types, such as "A", "AAAA", or "TYPE65534".
///
/// This class consults a helper \c RRParamRegistry class, which is a registry
/// of RR related parameters and has the singleton object.  This registry
/// provides a mapping between RR type codes and their "well-known" textual
/// representations.
/// Parameters of RR types defined by DNS protocol standards are automatically
/// registered at initialization time and are ensured to be always available for
/// applications unless the application explicitly modifies the registry.
///
/// For convenience, this class defines constant class objects corresponding to
/// standard RR types.  These are generally referred to as the form of
/// <code>RRType::{type-text}()</code>.
/// For example, \c RRType::NS() is an \c RRType object corresponding to the NS
/// resource record (type code 2).
/// Note that these constants are used through a "proxy" function.
/// This is because they may be used to initialize another non-local (e.g.
/// global or namespace-scope) static object as follows:
///
/// \code
/// namespace foo {
/// const RRType default_type = RRType::A();
/// } \endcode
///
/// In order to ensure that the constant RRType object has been initialized
/// before the initialization for \c default_type, we need help from
/// the proxy function.
///
/// In the current implementation, the initialization of the well-known
/// static objects is not thread safe.  The same consideration as the
/// \c RRParamRegistry class applies.  We may extend the implementation so
/// that the initialization is ensured to be thread safe in a future version.
///
/// Note to developers: since it's expected that some of these constant
/// \c RRType objects are frequently used in a performance sensitive path,
/// we define these proxy functions as inline.  This makes sense only when
/// the corresponding static objects are defined only once even if they used
/// in different source files.  Sufficiently modern compilers should meet
/// this assumption, but if we encounter memory bloat due to this problem with
/// particular compilers we need to revisit the design or think about
/// workaround.

    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>The <command>b10-loadzone</command> utility
      loads a RFC 1035 style DNS master zone file and stores it
      in a BIND 10 ready data source format.
      Master files are text files that contain DNS Resource Records
      in text form.
    </para>
    <note><simpara>Currently only the SQLITE3 data source is supported.
    </simpara></note>

    <para>
    Some control entries (aka directives) are supported.
    $ORIGIN is followed by a domain name, and sets the the origin
    that will be used for relative domain names in subsequent records.
    $INCLUDE is followed by a filename to load.
    The previous origin is restored after the file is included.
<!-- the current domain name is also restored -->
    $TTL is followed by a time-to-live value which is used
    by any following records that don't specify a TTL.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the specified zone does not exist in the specified data
      source, <command>b10-loadzone</command> will first create a
      new empty zone in the data source, then fill it with the RRs
      given in the specified master zone file.  In this case, if
      loading fails for some reason, the creation of the new zone
      is also canceled.
      <note><simpara>
	Due to an implementation limitation, the current version
	does not make the zone creation and subsequent loading an
	atomic operation; an empty zone will be visible and used by
	other application (e.g., the <command>b10-auth</command>
	authoritative server) while loading.  If this is an issue,
	make sure the initial loading of a new zone is done before
	starting other BIND 10 applications.
      </simpara></note>
    </para>

    <para>
      When re-loading an existing zone, the prior version is completely
      removed.  While the new version of the zone is being loaded, the old
      version remains accessible to queries.  After the new version is
      completely loaded, the old version is swapped out and replaced
      with the new one in a single operation.  If loading fails for
      some reason, the loaded RRs will be effectively deleted, and the
      old version will still remain accessible for other applications.

        <listitem><para>
	    Enable dumping debug level logging with the specified
	    level.  By default, only log messages at the severity of
	    informational or higher levels will be produced.

      <varlistentry>
        <term>-i <replaceable class="parameter">report_interval</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
          Specifies the interval of status update by the number of RRs
	  loaded in the interval.
	  The <command>b10-loadzone</command> tool periodically
          reports the progress of loading with the total number of
          loaded RRs and elapsed time.  This option specifies the
	  interval of the reports.  If set to 0, status reports will
          be suppressed.  The default is 10,000.
        </para></listitem>

        <term>-t <replaceable class="parameter">datasrc_type</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
          Specifies the type of data source to store the zone.
	  Currently, only the "sqlite3" type is supported (which is
          the default of this option), which means the SQLite3 data
          source.

        <term>-C <replaceable class="parameter">zone_class</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
          Specifies the RR class of the zone.
	  Currently, only class IN is supported (which is the default
          of this option) due to limitation of the underlying data
          source implementation.
        </para></listitem>

        <term>-c <replaceable class="parameter">datasrc_config</replaceable></term>
        <listitem><para>
          Specifies configuration of the data source in the JSON
          format.  The configuration contents depend on the type of
	  the data source, and that's the same as what would be
	  specified for the BIND 10 servers (see the data source
          configuration section of the BIND 10 guide).  For example,
	  for an SQLite3 data source, it would look like
	  '{"database_file": "path-to-sqlite3-db-file"}'.
	  <note>
	    <simpara>This option currently cannot be omitted.  In a future
              version it will be possible to retrieve the configuration from
              the BIND 10 server configuration (if it exists).

    <title>AUTHORS</title>
    <para>
      A prior version of the <command>b10-loadzone</command> tool was
      written by Evan Hunt of ISC.
      The new version that this manual refers to was rewritten from
      the scratch by the BIND 10 development team in around December 2012.

  <refsect1>
    <title>BUGS</title>
    <para>
      As of the initial implementation, the underlying library that
      this tool uses does not fully validate the loaded zone; for
      example, loading will succeed even if it doesn't have the SOA or
      NS record at its origin name.  Such checks will be implemented
      in a near future version, but until then, the
      <command>b10-loadzone</command> performs the existence of the
      SOA and NS records by itself.  However, <command>b10-loadzone</command>
      only warns about it, and does not cancel the load itself.
      If this warning message is produced, it's the user's
      responsibility to fix the errors and reload it.  When the
      library is updated with the post load checks, it will be more
      sophisticated and the such zone won't be successfully loaded.

      There are some other issues noted in the DESCRIPTION section.

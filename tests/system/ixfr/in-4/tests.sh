# This script performs the fourth IXFR-IN test.  A BIND 9 nameserver (the
# "server") contains a version of the zone (version N) and has IXFRs enabled.
# A BIND 10 nameserver (the "client") is loaded with version N-2 of the zone
# and a small refresh time.  After this expires, the IXFR client should have
# sent an IXFR request to the IXFR server.

# here is that starting the two systems and reloading the IXFR server takes
# less time than the SOA refresh time set in the "db.example.n2.refresh" zone
# file.

/// @brief Specifies an interface for classes creating HTTP responses
/// from HTTP requests.
///
/// HTTP is designed to carry various content types. Most commonly
/// this is text/html. In Kea, the application/json content type is used
/// to carry control commands in JSON format. The libkea-http library is
/// meant to be generic and provide means for transferring different types
/// of content, depending on the use case.
///
/// This abstract class specifies a common interface for generating HTTP
/// responses from HTTP requests using specific content type and being
/// used in some specific context. Kea modules providing HTTP services need to
/// implement their specific derivations of the @ref HttpResponseCreator
/// class. These derivations use classes derived from @ref HttpRequest as
/// an input and classes derived from @ref HttpResponse as an output of
/// @c createHttpResponse method.

    ///
    /// This class implements a generic logic for creating a HTTP response.
    /// Derived classes do not override this method. They merely implement
    /// the methods it calls.
    ///
    /// The request processing may generally fail at one of the two stages:
    /// parsing or interpretation of the parsed request. During the former
    /// stage the request's syntax is checked, i.e. HTTP version, URI,
    /// headers etc. During the latter stage the HTTP server checks if the
    /// request is valid within the specific context, e.g. valid HTTP version
    /// used, expected content type etc.
    ///
    /// In the @ref HttpRequest terms, the request has gone through the
    /// first stage if it is "finalized" (see @ref HttpRequest::finalize).
    /// This method accepts instances of both finalized and not finalized
    /// requests. If the request isn't finalized it indicates that
    /// the request parsing has failed. In such case, this method calls
    /// @c createStockBadRequest to generate a response with HTTP 400 status
    /// code. If the request is finalized, this method calls
    /// @c createDynamicHttpResponse to generate implementation specific
    /// response to the received request.
    ///
    /// This method is marked virtual final to prevent derived classes from
    /// overriding this method. Instead, the derived classes must implement
    /// protected methods which this method calls.

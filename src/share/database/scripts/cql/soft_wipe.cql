-- This is the soft wipe script for CQL (Cassandra). This capability may be
-- used when running Cassandra unit-tests.
--
-- In some deployments (e.g. in case of Tomek's dev system) Cassandra tests take
-- a very long time to execute. This was traced back to slow table/indexes
-- creation/deletion. With full wipe and recreation of all structures, it
-- took over 60 seconds for each test to execute. To avoid this problem, a
-- feature called soft-wipe has been implemented. If enabled, it does not
-- remove the structures, just the data from essential tables. To enable
-- it set KEA_TEST_CASSANDRA_WIPE environment variable to 'soft'. Make sure
-- that the database schema is set up properly before running in soft-wipe
-- mode.

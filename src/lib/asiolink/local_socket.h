/// expected usage, but it can be extended as we see need for other operations
/// on this socket.

    /// are available for read from the socket or an error happens, the
    /// specified callback will be called.  In the former case the data are
    /// copied into the given buffer (pointed to by \c buf); in the latter
    /// case, the \c error parameter of the callback will be set to a non
    /// empty string.
    ///
    /// In the case of error, this socket should be considered
    /// unusable anymore, because this class doesn't provide a feasible way
    /// to identify where in the input stream to restart reading.  So,
    /// in practice, the user of this socket should destroy this socket,
    /// and, if necessary to continue, create a new one.
    ///
    /// \c buf must point to a memory region that has at least \c buflen
    /// bytes of valid space.  That region must be kept valid until the
    /// callback is called or the \c IOService passed to the constructor
    /// is stopped.  This method and class do not check these conditions;
    /// it's the caller's responsibility to guarantee them.

    /// \note If asyncRead() has been called and hasn't been completed (with
    /// the callback being called), it's possible that the callback is called
    /// even after the \c LocalSocket object is destroyed.  So the caller
    /// has to make sure that either \c LocalSocket is valid until the

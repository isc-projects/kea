  71.  [func]		each
  	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

  70.  [func]		each
  	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

  69.  [func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

  68.  [func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c(--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable 
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file', 
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

  67.  [func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

  66.  [bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop.  (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)
    
  65.  [func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

  64.  [func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

  63.  [func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable 
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

  62.  [func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

  61.  [bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

  60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

  59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc,bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

  58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

  57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

  56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

  55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Track #136, svn r2147)

  54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

  53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using 
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(), 
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own 
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

  52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process, 
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file 
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't 
	be removed, exit from python.
	(Trac #151, svn r2091)

bind10-devel-20100602 released on June 2, 2010

  51.   [build]		jelte

	possibly other configure-time variables. Allow some components
	to find spec files in build tree when ran from source.
	(Trac #223)

  50.	[bug]		zhanglikun

	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

  49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. (Trac #183, svn r2009)

  48.	[func]		jelte

	(svn r2007)

  47.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/cmdctl: Add value/type check for commands sent to
	cmdctl. (Trac #201, svn r1959)

	lib/cc: Fix real type data encoding/decoding. (Trac #193,
	svn r1959)

  39.   [func]*         each
	Renamed libauth to libdatasrc.

  38.   [bug]           zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.
	Remove unused socket file when Xfrout process exits. Make sure Xfrout
	exit by itself when it receives SIGINT, instead of being killed by the
	signal SIGTERM or SIGKILL sent from boss.
	(Trac #135, #151, #134, svn r1797)

  37.   [build]         jinmei
	Check for the availability of python-config.  (Trac #159,

	command arguments. (Trac #219, svn r2022)

  34.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/xfrin: fixed several small bugs with many additional unit
	tests.  Fixes include: IPv6 transport support, resource leak,
	and non IN class support. (Trac #185, svn r2000)

  33.   [bug]           each
	bin/auth: output now prepended with "[b10-auth]" (Trac
	#109, svn r1985)

  32.	[func]*		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
        boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
        headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
        using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)

  31.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)

  30.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,
	and invalid parameters could cause integer overflow and make the
	library crash. (Trac #177, svn r1806)

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation.  This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix.  This is no different than a general bug fix
	except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause 
	security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

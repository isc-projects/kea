/// \brief Represents a list of packets with a sequential and random access to
/// list elements.
///
/// The main purpose of this class is to support sending Renew and Release
/// messages from perfdhcp. The Renew and Release messages are sent for existing
/// leases only. Therefore, the typical use case for this class is that it holds
/// a list of Rely messages sent by the server in response to Request messages.
/// The Request messages hold addresses and/or IPv6 prefixes acquired so they
/// can be used to identify existing leases. When perfdhcp needs to send Renew
/// or Release message, it will access one of the elements on this list and
/// will create the Renew or Release message based on its content. Once the
/// element (packet) is returned it is also deleted from the list, so as it is
/// not used again. This class provide either sequential access to the packets
/// or random access. The random access algorithm is much slower but at least
/// it allows to simulate more real scenario when the renewing or releasing
/// client is random.
///
/// \tparam Pkt4 or Pkt6 class, which represents DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 message
/// respectively.
///
/// \note Although the class is intended to hold Pkt4 and Pkt6 objects, the
/// current implementation is generic enough to holds any object wrapped in the
/// boost::shared_ptr.

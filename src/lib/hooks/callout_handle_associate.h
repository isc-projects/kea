/// @brief Base class for classes which need to be associated with
/// a @c CalloutHandle object.
///
/// The @c CalloutHandle is an object used to pass various parameters
/// between Kea and the callouts. The Kea servers usually invoke
/// multiple different callouts for a single packet such as DHCP
/// packet, control command etc. Therefore, it is required to
/// associate this packet with an instance of the callout handle, so
/// this instance can be used for all callouts invoked for this
/// packet.
///
/// Previously this association was made by the @c CalloutHandleStore
/// class. However, with the introduction of parallel processing
/// of packets (DHCP packets parking) it became awkward to use.
/// Attempts to extend this class to hold a map of associations
/// failed because of no easy way to garbage collect unused handles.
///
/// The easiest way to deal with this is to provide ownership of the
/// @c CalloutHandle to the object with which it is associated. The
/// class of this object needs to derive from this class. When the
/// object (e.g. DHCP packet) goes out of scope and is destroyed
/// this instance is destroyed as well.

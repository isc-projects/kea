/// @brief Defines elements for storing the names of client classes
///
/// This file defines common elements used to track the client classes
/// that may be associated with a given packet.  In order to minimize the
/// exposure of the DHCP library to server side concepts such as client
/// classification the classes herein provide a mechanism to maintain lists
/// of class names, rather than the classes they represent.  It is the
/// upper layers' perogative to use these names as they see fit.
///
/// @todo This file should be moved to dhcpsrv eventually as the classification
/// is server side concept. Client has no notion of classifying incoming server
/// messages as it usually talks to only one server. That move is not possible
/// yet, as the Pkt4 and Pkt6 classes have server-side implementation, even
/// though they reside in the dhcp directory.

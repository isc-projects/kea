///
/// Given a datasource type and a type-specific set of configuration data,
/// the corresponding dynamic library is loaded (if it hadn't been already),
/// and an instance is created. This instance is stored within this structure,
/// and can be accessed through getInstance(). Upon destruction of this
/// container, the stored instance of the DataSourceClient is deleted with
/// the destructor function provided by the loaded library.
///
/// The 'type' is actually the name of the library, minus the '_ds.so' postfix
/// Datasource implementation libraries therefore have a fixed name, both for
/// easy recognition and to reduce potential mistakes.
/// For example, the sqlite3 implementation has the type 'sqlite3', and the
/// derived filename 'sqlite3_ds.so'
/// The value of type can be a specific loadable library; if it already ends
/// with '.so', the loader will not add '_ds.so'.
/// It may also be an absolute path; if it starts with '/', nothing is
/// prepended. If it does not, the loadable library will be taken from the
/// installation directory, see the value of
/// isc::datasrc::BACKEND_LIBRARY_PATH in datasrc_config.h for the exact path.
///
/// \note When 'B10_FROM_BUILD' is set in the environment, the build
///       directory is used instead of the install directory.
///
/// There are of course some demands to an implementation, not all of which
/// can be verified compile-time. It must provide a creator and destructor
/// functions. The creator function must return an instance of a subclass of
/// DataSourceClient. The prototypes of these functions are as follows:
/// \code
/// extern "C" DataSourceClient* createInstance(isc::data::ConstElementPtr cfg);
///
/// extern "C" void destroyInstance(isc::data::DataSourceClient* instance);

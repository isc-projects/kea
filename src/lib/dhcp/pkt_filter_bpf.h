/// @brief Packet handling class using Berkeley Packet Filtering (BPF)
///
/// The BPF is supported on the BSD-like operating systems. It allows for access
/// to low level layers of the inbound and outbound packets. This is specifically
/// useful when the DHCP server is allocating new address to the client.
///
/// The response being sent to the client must include the HW address in the
/// datalink layer. When the regular datagram socket is used the kernel will
/// determine the HW address of the destination using ARP. In the case when
/// the DHCP server is allocating the new address for the client the ARP can't
/// be used because it requires the destination to have the IP address.
///
/// The DHCP server utilizes HW address sent by the client in the DHCP message
/// and stores it in the datalink layer of the outbound packet. The BPF provides
/// the means for crafting the whole packet (including datalink and network
/// layers) and injecting the hardware address of the client.
///
/// The DHCP server receiving the messages sent from the directly connected
/// clients to the broadcast address must be able to determine the interface
/// on which the message arrives. The Linux kernel provides the SO_BINDTODEVICE
/// socket option which allows for binding the socket to the particular
/// interface. This option is not implemented on the BSD-like operating
/// systems. This implies that there may be only one datagram socket listening
/// to broadcast messages and this socket would receive the traffic on all
/// interfaces. This effectively precludes the server from identifying the
/// interface on which the packet arrived. The BPF resolves this problem.
/// The BPF device (socket) can be attached to the selected interface using
/// the ioctl function.
///
/// In nutshell, the BPF device is created by opening the file /dev/bpf%d
/// where %d is a number. The BPF device is configured by issuing ioctl
/// commands listed here: http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?bpf(4).
/// The specific configuration used by Kea DHCP server is described in
/// documentation of @c PktFilterBPF::openSocket.
///
/// Use of BPF requires Kea to encode and decode the datalink and network
/// layer headers. Currently Kea supports encoding and decoding ethernet
/// frames on physical interfaces and pseudo headers received on local
/// loopback interface.

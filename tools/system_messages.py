# This tool reads all the .mes files in the directory tree whose root is given
# on the command line and interprets them as message files.  It pulls
# all the messages and description out, sorts them by message ID, and writes
# them out as a single (formatted) file.
#
# Invocation:
# The code is invoked using the command line:
#
# python system_messages.py [-o <output-file>] <top-source-directory>
#
# If no output file is specified, output is written to stdout.

    <para>
      This document lists each message that can be logged by the
      programs in the Kea package.  Each entry in this manual
      is of the form:
      <screen>IDENTIFICATION message-text</screen>
      ... where "IDENTIFICATION" is the message identification included
      in each message logged and "message-text" is the accompanying
      message text.  The "message-text" may include placeholders of the
      form "%1", "%2" etc.; these parameters are replaced by relevant
      values when the message is logged.
    </para>
    <para>
      Each entry is also accompanied by a description giving more
      information about the circumstances that result in the message
      being logged.

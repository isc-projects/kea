    <title>The DHCP-DDNS Server</title>

    <section id="dhcp-ddns-overview">
      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>
      The DHCP-DDNS Server (kea-dhcp-ddns, known informally as D2) conducts
      the client side of the Dynamic DNS protocol (DDNS, defined in <link
      xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2136">RFC 2136</link>)
      on behalf of the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers (kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6
      respectively). The DHCP servers construct DDNS update requests, known
      as NameChangeRequests (NCRs), based on DHCP lease change events and
      then post them to D2. D2 attempts to match each request to the
      appropriate DNS server(s) and carries out the necessary conversation with
      those servers to update the DNS data.
    </para>
    <section id="dhcp-ddns-dns-server-selection">
      <title>DNS Server Selection</title>
      <para>
      In order to match a request to the appropriate DNS servers, D2 must have a
      catalog of servers from which to select. In fact, D2 has two such catalogs,
      one for forward DNS and one for reverse DNS; these catalogs are referred
      to as DDNS Domain Lists. Each list consists of one or more named DDNS
      Domains. Further, each DDNS Domain has a list of one or more DNS
      servers that publish the DNS data for that domain.
      </para>
      <para>
      When conducting forward domain matching, D2 compares the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) in
      the request against the name of each Forward DDNS Domain in its catalog. The domain
      whose name matches the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the
      best match. For example, if the FQDN is "myhost.sample.example.com.",
      and there are two forward domains in the catalog, "sample.example.com."
      and "example.com.", the former is regarded as the best match. In some
      cases, it may not be possible to find a suitable match. Given the same two
      forward domains there would be no match for the FQDN, "bogus.net", so the
      request would be rejected. Finally, if there are no Forward DDNS Domains
      defined, D2 simply disregards the forward update portion of requests.
      </para>
      <para>
      When conducting reverse domain matching, D2 constructs a reverse
      FQDN from the lease address in the request and compares that against
      the name of each Reverse DDNS Domain. Again, the domain whose name matches
      the longest portion of the FQDN is considered the best match. For instance,
      if the lease address is "172.16.1.40" and there are two reverse domains in
      the catalog, "1.16.172.in-addr.arpa." and "16.172.in-addr.arpa", the
      former is the best match. As with forward matching, it may not
      find a suitable match. Given the same two domains, there would be no
      match for the lease address, "192.168.1.50", and the request would be
      rejected. Finally, if there are no Reverse DDNS Domains defined, D2 will
      simply disregard the reverse update portion of requests.
      </para>

    <section xml:id="dhcp-ddns-conflict-resolution">
      <title>Conflict Resolution</title>
        <para>
        D2 implements the conflict resolution strategy prescribed by
        <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4703">RFC 4703</ulink>.
        Conflict resolution is intended to prevent different clients from
        mapping to the same FQDN at the same time. To make this possible, the
        RFC requires that forward DNS entries for a given FQDN must be
        accompanied by a DHCID resource record (RR). This record contains a
        client identifier that uniquely identifies the client to whom the name
        belongs. Furthermore, any DNS updater that wishes to update or remove
        existing forward entries for an FQDN may only do so if their client
        matches that of the DHCID RR.
        </para>
        <para>
        In other words, the DHCID RR maps an FQDN to the client to whom it
        belongs, and thereafter changes to that mapping should only be
        done by or at the behest of that client.
        </para>
        <para>
        Currently, conflict detection is always performed.

      <title>Dual-Stack Environments</title>
      <para>
        <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4703#section-5.2">RFC 4703,
        section 5.2,</ulink> describes issues that may arise with dual-stack
        clients. These are clients that wish to have have both IPv4 and IPv6
        mappings for the same FQDN. For this to work properly, the
        clients are required to embed their IPv6 DUID within their IPv4 client
        identifier option as described in
        <ulink url="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4361">RFC 4703</ulink>.
        In this way, DNS updates for both IPv4 and IPv6 can be managed under
        the same DHCID RR. Support for this does not yet exist in Kea.

      <command>kea-dhcp-ddns</command> is the Kea DHCP-DDNS server
      and, due to the nature of DDNS, it runs alongside either the
      DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 component (or both). Like other parts of
      Kea, it is a separate binary that can be run on its own or through

            code (0 = configuration looks ok, 1 = error encountered).

        is possible, though unlikely, that the file is a remnant of a system crash
        and the process to which the PID belongs is unrelated to Kea. In such a
        case it is necessary to manually delete the PID file.

        <para>To use TSIG when updating entries in a DNS Domain,
        a key must be defined in the TSIG Key List and referenced by
        name in that domain's configuration entry. When D2 matches a
        change request to a domain, it checks whether the domain has
        a TSIG key associated with it. If so, D2 will use that key to
        sign DNS update messages sent to and verify responses received
        from the domain's DNS server(s). For each TSIG key required by

        As an example, suppose that a domain D2 will be updating is
        maintained by a BIND 9 DNS server, which requires dynamic updates
        to be secured with TSIG. Suppose further that the entry for
        the TSIG key in BIND 9's named.conf file looks like this:
<screen>
   :
   key "key.four.example.com." {
       algorithm hmac-sha224;
       secret "bZEG7Ow8OgAUPfLWV3aAUQ==";

<screen>
"DhcpDdns": {
   <userinput>"tsig-keys": [ ]</userinput>,

        We must extend the list with a new key:

"DhcpDdns": {
    "tsig-keys": [
    <userinput>    {

        As discussed earlier, FQDN-to-domain matching is based on the longest
        match. The FQDN, "myhost.four.example.com.", will match the first
        domain ("four.example.com") while "admin.example.com." will match the
        third domain ("example.com"). The
        FQDN, "other.example.net.", will fail to match any domain and is
        rejected.

        The following example configuration specifies the Forward DDNS Domains.

        An address of "192.0.2.150" will match the first domain,

        the third domain.

            Requests received from the DHCP servers are placed in a
            queue until they are processed. Currently, all queued requests
            are lost when the server shuts down.

      <para>BIND 10 is a framework that features Domain Name System
      (DNS) suite and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      servers managed by Internet Systems Consortium (ISC). It
      includes DNS libraries, modular components for controlling
      authoritative and recursive DNS servers, and experimental DHCPv4
      and DHCPv6 servers.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      BIND is the popular implementation of a DNS server, developer
      interfaces, and DNS tools.
      BIND 10 is a rewrite of BIND 9.  BIND 10 is written in C++ and Python
      and provides a modular environment for serving and maintaining DNS.
      BIND 10 provides a EDNS0- and DNSSEC-capable authoritative
      DNS server and a caching recursive name server which also
      provides forwarding.
    </para>

    <para>
      This guide covers the experimental prototype of
      BIND 10 version &__VERSION__;.

      <title>Supported Platforms</title>
      <para>
  BIND 10 builds have been tested on Debian GNU/Linux 5 and unstable,
  Ubuntu 9.10, NetBSD 5, Solaris 10, FreeBSD 7 and 8, CentOS
  Linux 5.3, and MacOS 10.6.

  It has been tested on Sparc, i386, and amd64 hardware
  platforms.

        It is planned for BIND 10 to build, install and run on
        Windows and standard Unix-type platforms.

      <title>Starting and Stopping the Server</title>

      <para>
        BIND 10 is modular.  Part of this modularity is
        accomplished using multiple cooperating processes which, together,
        provide the server functionality.  This is a change from
        the previous generation of BIND software, which used a
        single process.
      </para>

      <para>
        At first, running many different processes may seem confusing.
        However, these processes are started, stopped, and maintained
        by a single command, <command>bind10</command>.
        This command starts a master process which will start other
        processes as needed.
        The processes started by the <command>bind10</command>
        command have names starting with "b10-", including:

    <title>Starting BIND10 with <command>bind10</command></title>
    <para>
      BIND 10 provides the <command>bind10</command> command which
      starts up the required processes.
      <command>bind10</command>
      will also restart some processes that exit unexpectedly.
      This is the only command needed to start the BIND 10 system.
    </para>

    <para>
      After starting the <command>b10-msgq</command> communications channel,
      <command>bind10</command> connects to it,
      runs the configuration manager, and reads its own configuration.
      Then it starts the other modules.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>b10-sockcreator</command>, <command>b10-msgq</command> and
      <command>b10-cfgmgr</command>
      services make up the core. The <command>b10-msgq</command> daemon
      provides the communication channel between every part of the system.
      The <command>b10-cfgmgr</command> daemon is always needed by every
      module, if only to send information about themselves somewhere,
      but more importantly to ask about their own settings, and
      about other modules. The <command>b10-sockcreator</command> will
      allocate sockets for the rest of the system.
    </para>

    <para>
      In its default configuration, the <command>bind10</command>
      master process will also start up
      <command>b10-cmdctl</command> for administration tools to
      communicate with the system,
      <command>b10-auth</command> for authoritative DNS service,
      <command>b10-stats</command> for statistics collection,
      <command>b10-stats-httpd</command> for statistics reporting,
      <command>b10-xfrin</command> for inbound DNS zone transfers,
      <command>b10-xfrout</command> for outbound DNS zone transfers,
      and <command>b10-zonemgr</command> for secondary service.
    </para>

    <section id="start">
      <title>Starting BIND 10</title>
      <para>
        To start the BIND 10 service, simply run <command>bind10</command>.
        Run it with the <option>--verbose</option> switch to
        get additional debugging or diagnostic output.

<!-- TODO: note it doesn't go into background -->

      <note>
        <para>
          If the setproctitle Python module is detected at start up,
          the process names for the Python-based daemons will be renamed
          to better identify them instead of just <quote>python</quote>.
          This is not needed on some operating systems.

    <section id="bind10.config">
      <title>Configuration of started processes</title>
      <para>
        The processes to be started can be configured, with the exception
        of the <command>b10-sockcreator</command>, <command>b10-msgq</command>
        and <command>b10-cfgmgr</command>.
      </para>

      <para>
        The configuration is in the Boss/components section. Each element
        represents one component, which is an abstraction of a process
        (currently there's also one component which doesn't represent
        a process). If you didn't want to transfer out at all (your server
        is a slave only), you would just remove the corresponding component
        from the set, like this and the process would be stopped immediately
        (and not started on the next startup):
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config remove Boss/components b10-xfrout</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        To add a process to the set, let's say the resolver (which not started
        by default), you would do this:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/special resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/kind needed</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver/priority 10</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen></para>

      <para>
        Now, what it means. We add an entry called b10-resolver. It is both a
        name used to reference this component in the configuration and the
        name of the process to start. Then we set some parameters on how to
        start it.
      </para>

      <para>
        The special one is for components that need some kind of special care
        during startup or shutdown. Unless specified, the component is started
        in usual way. This is the list of components that need to be started
        in a special way, with the value of special used for them:
        <table>
          <tgroup cols='3' align='left'>
          <colspec colname='component'/>
          <colspec colname='special'/>
          <colspec colname='description'/>
          <thead><row><entry>Component</entry><entry>Special</entry><entry>Description</entry></row></thead>
          <tbody>
            <row><entry>b10-auth</entry><entry>auth</entry><entry>Authoritative server</entry></row>
            <row><entry>b10-resolver</entry><entry>resolver</entry><entry>The resolver</entry></row>
            <row><entry>b10-cmdctl</entry><entry>cmdctl</entry><entry>The command control (remote control interface)</entry></row>
            <!-- TODO Either add xfrin and xfrout as well or clean up the workarounds in boss before the release -->
          </tbody>
          </tgroup>
        </table>
      </para>

      <para>
        The kind specifies how a failure of the component should
        be handled.  If it is set to <quote>dispensable</quote>
        (the default unless you set something else), it will get
        started again if it fails. If it is set to <quote>needed</quote>
        and it fails at startup, the whole <command>bind10</command>
        shuts down and exits with error exit code. But if it fails
        some time later, it is just started again. If you set it
        to <quote>core</quote>, you indicate that the system is
        not usable without the component and if such component
        fails, the system shuts down no matter when the failure
        happened.  This is the behaviour of the core components
        (the ones you can't turn off), but you can declare any
        other components as core as well if you wish (but you can
        turn these off, they just can't fail).
      </para>

      <para>
        The priority defines order in which the components should start.
        The ones with higher number are started sooner than the ones with
        lower ones. If you don't set it, 0 (zero) is used as the priority.
        Usually, leaving it at the default is enough.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are other parameters we didn't use in our example.
        One of them is <quote>address</quote>. It is the address
        used by the component on the <command>b10-msgq</command>
        message bus. The special components already know their
        address, but the usual ones don't. The address is by
        convention the thing after <emphasis>b10-</emphasis>, with
        the first letter capital (eg. <command>b10-stats</command>
        would have <quote>Stats</quote> as its address).
<!-- TODO: this should be simplified so we don't even have to document it -->
      </para>

<!-- TODO: what does "The special components already know their
address, but the usual ones don't." mean? -->

<!-- TODO: document params when is enabled -->

      <para>
        The last one is process. It is the name of the process to be started.
        It defaults to the name of the component if not set, but you can use
        this to override it.
      </para>

      <!-- TODO Add parameters when they work, not implemented yet-->

      <note>
        <para>
          This system allows you to start the same component multiple times
          (by including it in the configuration with different names, but the
          same process setting). However, the rest of the system doesn't expect
          such a situation, so it would probably not do what you want. Such
          support is yet to be implemented.
        </para>
      </note>

      <note>
        <para>
          The configuration is quite powerful, but that includes
          a lot of space for mistakes. You could turn off the
          <command>b10-cmdctl</command>, but then you couldn't
          change it back the usual way, as it would require it to
          be running (you would have to find and edit the configuration
          directly).  Also, some modules might have dependencies:
          <command>b10-stats-httpd</command> needs
          <command>b10-stats</command>, <command>b10-xfrout</command>
          needs <command>b10-auth</command> to be running, etc.

<!-- TODO: should we define dependencies? -->

        </para>
        <para>
          In short, you should think twice before disabling something here.
        </para>
      </note>
      <para>
        It is possible to start some components multiple times (currently
        <command>b10-auth</command> and <command>b10-resolzer</command>).
        You might want to do that to gain more performance (each one uses only
        single core). Just put multiple entries under different names, like
        this, with the same config:
        <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Boss/components b10-resolver-2</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver-2/special resolver</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Boss/components/b10-resolver-2/kind needed</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        However, this is work in progress and the support is not yet complete.
        For example, each resolver will have its own cache, each authoritative
        server will keep its own copy of in-memory data and there could be
        problems with locking the sqlite database, if used. The configuration
        might be changed to something more convenient in future.

      <para>
        The BIND 10 components use the <command>b10-msgq</command>

    <para>
      Incoming zones are transferred using the <command>b10-xfrin</command>
      process which is started by <command>bind10</command>.
      When received, the zone is stored in the corresponding BIND 10
      data source, and its records can be served by
      <command>b10-auth</command>.
      In combination with <command>b10-zonemgr</command> (for
      automated SOA checks), this allows the BIND 10 server to
      provide <quote>secondary</quote> service.
    </para>

    <para>
      The <command>b10-xfrin</command> process supports both AXFR and
      IXFR.  Due to some implementation limitations of the current
      development release, however, it only tries AXFR by default,
      and care should be taken to enable IXFR.
    </para>
<!-- TODO: http://bind10.isc.org/ticket/1279 -->

    <note><simpara>
     In the current development release of BIND 10, incoming zone
     transfers are only available for SQLite3-based data sources,
     that is, they don't work for an in-memory data source.
    </simpara></note>

    <section>
      <title>Configuration for Incoming Zone Transfers</title>
      <para>
        In practice, you need to specify a list of secondary zones to
        enable incoming zone transfers for these zones (you can still
        trigger a zone transfer manually, without a prior configuration
        (see below)).
      </para>

      <para>
        For example, to enable zone transfers for a zone named "example.com"
        (whose master address is assumed to be 2001:db8::53 here),
        run the following at the <command>bindctl</command> prompt:

      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config add Xfrin/zones</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/name "<option>example.com</option>"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/master_addr "<option>2001:db8::53</option>"</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>

      (We assume there has been no zone configuration before).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Enabling IXFR</title>
      <para>
        As noted above, <command>b10-xfrin</command> uses AXFR for
        zone transfers by default.  To enable IXFR for zone transfers
        for a particular zone, set the <userinput>use_ixfr</userinput>
        configuration parameter to <userinput>true</userinput>.
        In the above example of configuration sequence, you'll need
        to add the following before performing <userinput>commit</userinput>:
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrin/zones[0]/use_ixfr true</userinput></screen>
      </para>

<!-- TODO: http://bind10.isc.org/ticket/1279 -->
      <note><simpara>
      One reason why IXFR is disabled by default in the current
      release is because it does not support automatic fallback from IXFR to
      AXFR when it encounters a primary server that doesn't support
      outbound IXFR (and, not many existing implementations support
      it).  Another, related reason is that it does not use AXFR even
      if it has no knowledge about the zone (like at the very first
      time the secondary server is set up).  IXFR requires the
      "current version" of the zone, so obviously it doesn't work
      in this situation and AXFR is the only workable choice.
      The current release of <command>b10-xfrin</command> does not
      make this selection automatically.
      These features will be implemented in a near future
      version, at which point we will enable IXFR by default.

      When the <command>b10-auth</command> authoritative DNS server
      receives an AXFR or IXFR request, <command>b10-auth</command>
      internally forwards the request to <command>b10-xfrout</command>,
      which handles the rest of request processing.
      This is used to provide primary DNS service to share zones
      to secondary name servers.
      The <command>b10-xfrout</command> is also used to send
      NOTIFY messages to secondary servers.
    </para>

    <para>
      A global or per zone <option>transfer_acl</option> configuration
      can be used to control accessibility of the outbound zone
      transfer service.
      By default, <command>b10-xfrout</command> allows any clients to
      perform zone transfers for any zones:
    </para>

      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config show Xfrout/transfer_acl</userinput>
Xfrout/transfer_acl[0]	{"action": "ACCEPT"}	any	(default)</screen>

    <para>
      You can change this to, for example, rejecting all transfer
      requests by default while allowing requests for the transfer
      of zone "example.com" from 192.0.2.1 and 2001:db8::1 as follows:
    </para>

      <screen>&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrout/transfer_acl[0] {"action": "REJECT"}</userinput>

    <note><simpara>
        In the above example the lines

        readability.  In the actual input it must be in a single line.
    </simpara></note>

    <para>
      If you want to require TSIG in access control, a system wide TSIG
      "key ring" must be configured.
      For example, to change the previous example to allowing requests
      from 192.0.2.1 signed by a TSIG with a key name of
      "key.example", you'll need to do this:
    </para>

    <screen>&gt; <userinput>config set tsig_keys/keys ["key.example:&lt;base64-key&gt;"]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl [{"action": "ACCEPT", "from": "192.0.2.1", "key": "key.example"}]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput>config commit</userinput></screen>

    <para>Both Xfrout and Auth will use the system wide keyring to check
    TSIGs in the incomming messages and to sign responses.</para>

    <title>DHCPv4 Server</title>
    <para>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCP or
    DHCPv4) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)
    are protocols that allow one node (server) to provision
    configuration parameters to many hosts and devices (clients). To
    ease deployment in larger networks, additional nodes (relays) may
    be deployed that facilitate communication between servers and
    clients. Even though principles of both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are
    somewhat similar, these are two radically different
    protocols. BIND10 offers server implementations for both DHCPv4
    and DHCPv6. This chapter is about DHCP for IPv4. For a description
    of the DHCPv6 server, see <xref linkend="dhcp6"/>.</para>

    <para>The DHCPv4 server component is currently under intense

    <note>
      <para>
        As of December 2011, both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 components are
        skeleton servers. That means that while they are capable of
        performing DHCP configuration, they are not fully functional
        yet. In particular, neither has functional lease
        databases. This means that they will assign the same, fixed,
        hardcoded addresses to any client that will ask. See <xref
        linkend="dhcp4-limit"/> and <xref linkend="dhcp6-limit"/> for
        detailed description.

      <title>DHCPv4 Server Usage</title>
      <para>BIND10 provides the DHCPv4 server component since December
      2011. It is a skeleton server and can be described as an early
      prototype that is not fully functional yet. It is mature enough
      to conduct first tests in lab environment, but it has
      significant limitations. See <xref linkend="dhcp4-limit"/> for
      details.
      </para>

      <para>
        The DHCPv4 server is implemented as <command>b10-dhcp4</command>
        daemon. As it is not configurable yet, it is fully autonomous,
        that is it does not interact with <command>b10-cfgmgr</command>.
        To start DHCPv4 server, simply input:

        <screen>
#<userinput>cd src/bin/dhcp4</userinput>
#<userinput>./b10-dhcp4</userinput>
</screen>

        Depending on your installation, <command>b10-dhcp4</command>
        binary may reside in src/bin/dhcp4 in your source code
        directory, in /usr/local/bin/b10-dhcp4 or other directory
        you specified during compilation.

        At start, the server will detect available network interfaces
        and will attempt to open UDP sockets on all interfaces that
        are up, running, are not loopback, and have IPv4 address
        assigned.

        The server will then listen to incoming traffic. Currently
        supported client messages are DISCOVER and REQUEST. The server
        will respond to them with OFFER and ACK, respectively.

        Since the DHCPv4 server opens privileged ports, it requires root
        access. Make sure you run this daemon as root.</para>

        <note>
          <para>
            Integration with <command>bind10</command> is
            planned. Ultimately, <command>b10-dhcp4</command> will not
            be started directly, but rather via
            <command>bind10</command>. Please be aware of this planned

    <section>
      <title>Logging configuration</title>

      <para>

        The logging system in BIND 10 is configured through the
        Logging module. All BIND 10 modules will look at the
        configuration in Logging to see what should be logged and
        to where.

<!-- TODO: what is context of Logging module for readers of this guide? -->

      </para>

      <section>
        <title>Loggers</title>

        <para>

          Within BIND 10, a message is logged through a component
          called a "logger". Different parts of BIND 10 log messages
          through different loggers, and each logger can be configured
          independently of one another.

        </para>

        <para>

          In the Logging module, you can specify the configuration
          for zero or more loggers; any that are not specified will
          take appropriate default values..

        </para>

        <para>

          The three most important elements of a logger configuration
          are the <option>name</option> (the component that is
          generating the messages), the <option>severity</option>
          (what to log), and the <option>output_options</option>
          (where to log).

        </para>

        <section>
          <title>name (string)</title>

          <para>
          Each logger in the system has a name, the name being that
          of the component using it to log messages. For instance,
          if you want to configure logging for the resolver module,
          you add an entry for a logger named <quote>Resolver</quote>. This
          configuration will then be used by the loggers in the
          Resolver module, and all the libraries used by it.
              </para>

<!-- TODO: later we will have a way to know names of all modules

Right now you can only see what their names are if they are running
(a simple 'help' without anything else in bindctl for instance).

 -->

        <para>

          If you want to specify logging for one specific library
          within the module, you set the name to
          <replaceable>module.library</replaceable>.  For example, the
          logger used by the nameserver address store component
          has the full name of <quote>Resolver.nsas</quote>. If
          there is no entry in Logging for a particular library,
          it will use the configuration given for the module.

<!-- TODO: how to know these specific names?

We will either have to document them or tell the administrator to
specify module-wide logging and see what appears...

-->

        </para>

        <para>

<!-- TODO: severity has not been covered yet -->

          To illustrate this, suppose you want the cache library
          to log messages of severity DEBUG, and the rest of the
          resolver code to log messages of severity INFO. To achieve
          this you specify two loggers, one with the name
          <quote>Resolver</quote> and severity INFO, and one with
          the name <quote>Resolver.cache</quote> with severity
          DEBUG. As there are no entries for other libraries (e.g.
          the nsas), they will use the configuration for the module
          (<quote>Resolver</quote>), so giving the desired behavior.

        </para>

        <para>

          One special case is that of a module name of <quote>*</quote>
          (asterisks), which is interpreted as <emphasis>any</emphasis>
          module. You can set global logging options by using this,
          including setting the logging configuration for a library
          that is used by multiple modules (e.g. <quote>*.config</quote>
          specifies the configuration library code in whatever
          module is using it).

        </para>

        <para>

          If there are multiple logger specifications in the
          configuration that might match a particular logger, the
          specification with the more specific logger name takes
          precedence. For example, if there are entries for for
          both <quote>*</quote> and <quote>Resolver</quote>, the
          resolver module &mdash; and all libraries it uses &mdash;
          will log messages according to the configuration in the
          second entry (<quote>Resolver</quote>). All other modules
          will use the configuration of the first entry
          (<quote>*</quote>). If there was also a configuration
          entry for <quote>Resolver.cache</quote>, the cache library
          within the resolver would use that in preference to the
          entry for <quote>Resolver</quote>.

        </para>

        <para>

          One final note about the naming. When specifying the
          module name within a logger, use the name of the module
          as specified in <command>bindctl</command>, e.g.
          <quote>Resolver</quote> for the resolver module,
          <quote>Xfrout</quote> for the xfrout module, etc. When
          the message is logged, the message will include the name
          of the logger generating the message, but with the module
          name replaced by the name of the process implementing
          the module (so for example, a message generated by the
          <quote>Auth.cache</quote> logger will appear in the output
          with a logger name of <quote>b10-auth.cache</quote>).

        </para>

        </section>

        <section>
          <title>severity (string)</title>

        <para>

          This specifies the category of messages logged.
          Each message is logged with an associated severity which
          may be one of the following (in descending order of
          severity):

        <para>

          When the severity of a logger is set to one of these
          values, it will only log messages of that severity, and
          the severities above it. The severity may also be set to
          NONE, in which case all messages from that logger are
          inhibited.

        </para>

          is true in the second, it will write the log messages
          not only to the destinations specified for
          <quote>Resolver.cache</quote>, but also to the destinations
          as specified in the <option>output_options</option> in

        <para>

          Of course, we need to specify where we want the log
          messages to go, so we add an entry for an output option.

        </para>

        <para>

          These aren't the values we are looking for.

        </para>

        <para>

          Which would make the entire configuration for this logger
          look like:

        </para>

        <para>

          <screen>&gt; <userinput> config show all Logging/loggers</userinput>

</screen>

        </para>

        <para>

          That looks OK, so let's commit it before we add the
          configuration for the authoritative server's logger.

        </para>

        <para>

          <screen>&gt; <userinput> config commit</userinput></screen>

        </para>

        <para>

          Now that we have set it, and checked each value along
          the way, adding a second entry is quite similar.

        </para>

        <para>

          <screen>&gt; <userinput> config add Logging/loggers</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config set Logging/loggers[1]/name Auth</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config set Logging/loggers[1]/severity DEBUG</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config set Logging/loggers[1]/debuglevel 40</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config add Logging/loggers[1]/output_options</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config set Logging/loggers[1]/output_options[0]/destination file</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config set Logging/loggers[1]/output_options[0]/output /tmp/auth_debug.log</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config commit</userinput>
</screen>

        </para>

        <para>

          And that's it. Once we have found whatever it was we
          needed the debug messages for, we can simply remove the
          second logger to let the authoritative server use the
          same settings as the rest.

        </para>

        <para>

          <screen>&gt; <userinput> config remove Logging/loggers[1]</userinput>
&gt; <userinput> config commit</userinput>
</screen>

        </para>

        <para>

          And every module will now be using the values from the
          logger named <quote>*</quote>.

      <title>Logging Message Format</title>

      <para>
          Each message written by BIND 10 to the configured logging
          destinations comprises a number of components that identify
          the origin of the message and, if the message indicates
          a problem, information about the problem that may be
          useful in fixing it.
      </para>

      <para>
          Consider the message below logged to a file:
          <screen>2011-06-15 13:48:22.034 ERROR [b10-resolver.asiolink]
    ASIODNS_OPENSOCK error 111 opening TCP socket to 127.0.0.1(53)</screen>
      </para>

      <para>
        Note: the layout of messages written to the system logging
        file (syslog) may be slightly different.  This message has
        been split across two lines here for display reasons; in the
        logging file, it will appear on one line.)
      </para>

      <para>
        The log message comprises a number of components:

          <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
          <term>2011-06-15 13:48:22.034</term>
<!-- TODO: timestamp repeated even if using syslog? -->
          <listitem><para>
              The date and time at which the message was generated.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>ERROR</term>
          <listitem><para>
              The severity of the message.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>[b10-resolver.asiolink]</term>
          <listitem><para>
            The source of the message.  This comprises two components:
            the BIND 10 process generating the message (in this
            case, <command>b10-resolver</command>) and the module
            within the program from which the message originated
            (which in the example is the asynchronous I/O link
            module, asiolink).
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>ASIODNS_OPENSOCK</term>
          <listitem><para>
            The message identification.  Every message in BIND 10
            has a unique identification, which can be used as an
            index into the <ulink
            url="bind10-messages.html"><citetitle>BIND 10 Messages
            Manual</citetitle></ulink> (<ulink
            url="http://bind10.isc.org/docs/bind10-messages.html"
            />) from which more information can be obtained.
          </para></listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
          <term>error 111 opening TCP socket to 127.0.0.1(53)</term>
          <listitem><para>
              A brief description of the cause of the problem.
              Within this text, information relating to the condition
              that caused the message to be logged will be included.
              In this example, error number 111 (an operating
              system-specific error number) was encountered when
              trying to open a TCP connection to port 53 on the
              local system (address 127.0.0.1).  The next step
              would be to find out the reason for the failure by
              consulting your system's documentation to identify
              what error number 111 means.

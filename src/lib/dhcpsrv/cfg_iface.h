/// @brief Represents selection of interfaces for DHCP server.
///
/// This class manages selection of interfaces on which the DHCP server is
/// listening to queries. The interfaces are selected in the server
/// configuration by their names or by the pairs of interface names and
/// addresses, e.g. eth0/2001:db8:1::1 (DHCPv6) or e.g. eth0/192.168.8.1
/// (DHCPv4).
///
/// This class also accepts "wildcard" interface name which, if specified,
/// instructs the server to listen on all available interfaces.
///
/// Once interfaces have been specified the sockets (either IPv4 or IPv6)
/// can be opened by calling @c CfgIface::openSockets function. Kea
/// offers configuration parameters to control the types of sockets to be
/// opened by the DHCPv4 server. In small deployments it is requires that
/// the server can handle messages from the directly connected clients
/// which don't have an address yet. Unicasting the response to such
/// client is possible by the use of raw sockets. In larger deployments
/// it is often the case that whole traffic is received via relays, and
/// in such case the use of UDP sockets is preferred. The type of the
/// sockets to be opened is specified using one of the
/// @c CfgIface::useSocketType method variants. The @c CfgIface::SocketType
/// enumeration specifies the possible values.
///
/// @warning This class makes use of the AF_INET and AF_INET6 family literals,
/// but it doesn't verify that the address family value passed as @c uint16_t
/// parameter is equal to one of them. It is a callers responsibility to
/// guarantee that the address family value is correct.
///
/// The interface name is passed as an argument of the @ref CfgIface::use
/// function which controls the selection of the interface on which the
/// DHCP queries should be received by the server. The interface name
/// passed as the argument of this function may appear in one of the following
/// formats:
/// - interface-name, e.g. eth0
/// - interface-name/address, e.g. eth0/2001:db8:1::1 or eth0/192.168.8.1
///
/// Extraneous spaces surrounding the interface name and/or address
/// are accepted. For example: eth0 / 2001:db8:1::1 will be accepted.
///
/// When only interface name is specified (without an address) it is allowed
/// to use the "wildcard" interface name (*) which indicates that the server
/// should open sockets on all interfaces. When IPv6 is in use, the sockets
/// will be bound to the link local addresses. Wildcard interface names are
/// not allowed when specifying a unicast address. For example:
/// */2001:db8:1::1 is not allowed.
///
/// The DHCPv6 configuration accepts simultaneous use of the "interface-name"
/// and "interface-name/address" tuple for the same interface, e.g.
/// "eth0", "eth0/2001:db8:1::1" specifies that the server should open a
/// socket and bind to link local address as well as open a socket bound to
/// the specified unicast address.
///
/// The DHCPv4 configuration doesn't accept the simultaneous use of the
/// "interface-name" and the "interface-name/address" tuple for the
/// given interface. When the "interface-name" is specified it implies
/// that the sockets will be opened on for all addresses configured on
/// this interface. If the tuple of "interface-name/address" is specified
/// there will be only one socket opened and bound to the specified address.
/// This socket will be configured to listen to the broadcast messages
/// reaching the interface as well as unicast messages sent to the address
/// to which it is bound. It is allowed to select multiple addresses on the
/// particular interface explicitly, e.g. "eth0/192.168.8.1",
/// "eth0/192.168.8.2".

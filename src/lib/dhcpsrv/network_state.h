/// @brief Controls the DHCP service enabling status.
///
/// Sometimes, a DHCP server must pause responding to the DHCP queries.
/// Typical cases include a database connection loss when the server tries
/// to reconnect and various cases related to the High Availability operation.
/// It is also possible to explicitly turn the DHCP service on and off via the
/// control channel. This class receives calls from different origins to
/// disable and re-enable the DHCP service.
///
/// The general rule is that the DHCP service must be disabled when the class
/// receives at least one request to disable the service from any origin. The
/// service must be re-enabled when all requestors previously disabling the
/// service re-enabled it. This class also allows for specifying a timeout value
/// for each request, after which the service gets re-enabled automatically. It
/// is particularly useful in HA when there is no guarantee that the HA partner
/// will be able to re-enable the service because it may experience an unexpected
/// outage. In that case, the "max-period" parameter must accompany the "dhcp-disable"
/// command to ensure that the service will eventually be re-enabled.

/// The HA hook library may include several independent relationships. Each
/// relationship is treated as a separate origin by this class. If one relationship
/// disables the DHCP service, the service must remain disabled even when any other
/// relationship requests enabling it. The service is re-enabled after all
/// relationships requested re-enabling it (e.g., they all finished synchronizing
/// the lease database).
///
/// The HA service instances must have unique identifiers they use to specify the
/// origin. For example, an @c HAService with the identifier of 1 should request
/// disabling the local service like this:
///
/// @code
///     NetworkState state;
///     state.disableService(NetworkState::HA_LOCAL_COMMAND + 1);
/// @endcode
///
/// The DHCP state can also be altered by the database recovery mechanism, which
/// disables the service on connection loss and re-enables it after the connection
/// is restored. Unlike in HA, this is implemented using an internal counter. In
/// this case, there is one origin for all database connections. The requests for
/// the @c NetworkState::DB_CONNECTION are counted, and the DHCP service is
/// re-enabled when the counter reaches 0.
///
/// @todo We should consider migrating the database recovery to the same mechanism
///  we use for the HA. The reference counting works because the database connection
/// classes ensure that for each request to disable the DHCP service, there is a
/// corresponding request to enable the service. It prevents the situation that the
/// service remains disabled because there were more requests to disable than to
/// enable the service. It is hard to ensure the same consistency for the HA.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS4_ALLOC_ERROR error during attempt to allocate an IPv4 address: %1
An error occurred during an attempt to allocate an IPv4 address, the
reason for the failure being contained in the message.  The server will
return a message to the client refusing a lease.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS4_ALLOC_FAIL failed to allocate an IPv4 address after %1 attempt(s)
THE DHCP allocation engine gave up trying to allocate an IPv4 address
after the specified number of attempts.  This probably means that the
address pool from which the allocation is being attempted is either
empty, or very nearly empty.  As a result, the client will have been
refused a lease.

This message may indicate that your address pool is too small for the
number of clients you are trying to service and should be expanded.
Alternatively, if the you know that the number of concurrently active
clients is less than the addresses you have available, you may want to
consider reducing the lease lifetime.  In this way, addresses allocated
to clients that are no longer active on the network will become available
available sooner.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS6_ALLOC_ERROR error during attempt to allocate an IPv6 address: %1
An error occurred during an attempt to allocate an IPv6 address, the
reason for the failure being contained in the message.  The server will
return a message to the client refusing a lease.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS6_ALLOC_FAIL failed to allocate an IPv6 address after %1 attempt(s)

% DHCPSRV_DHCP_DDNS_SUSPEND_UPDATES DHCP_DDNS updates are being suspended.
This is a warning message indicating the DHCP_DDNS updates have been turned
off.  This should only occur if IO errors communicating with b10-dhcp-ddns
have been experienced.  Any such errors should have preceding entries in the
log with details.  No further attempts to communicate with b10-dhcp-ddns will
be made without intervention.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_RENEW_SKIP DHCPv4 lease was not renewed because a callout set the skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_renew
hook point set the skip flag. For this particular hook point, the setting
of the flag by a callout instructs the server to not renew a lease. The
server will use existing lease as it is, without extending its lifetime.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_SELECT_SKIP Lease4 creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_select
hook point sets the skip flag. It means that the server was told that
no lease4 should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its
database and the client will get a NAK packet.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_SELECT_SKIP Lease6 (non-temporary) creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_select
hook point sets the skip flag. It means that the server was told that
no lease6 should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its
database and the client will get a NoAddrsAvail for that IA_NA option.

/// It's intended to provide a unified interface, whether the underlying
/// memory is local to a specific process or is sharable by multiple
/// processes.
///
/// This is an abstract class and a real implementation such as
/// MemorySegmentLocal should be used in code.

    ///
    /// The source of the memory is dependent on the implementation used.
    ///
    /// Depending on the implementation details, it may have to grow the
    /// internal memory segment (again, in an implementation dependent way)
    /// to allocate the required size of memory.  In that case the
    /// implementation must grow the internal segment sufficiently so the
    /// next call to allocate() for the same size will succeed, and throw
    /// a \c MemorySegmentGrown exception (not really allocating the memory
    /// yet).
    ///
    /// An application that uses this memory segment abstraction to allocate
    /// memory should expect this exception, and should normally catch it
    /// at an appropriate layer (which may be immediately after a call to
    /// \c allocate() or a bit higher layer).  It should interpret the
    /// exception as any raw address that belongs to the segment may have
    /// been remapped and must be re-fetched via an already established
    /// named address using the \c getNamedAddress() method.
    ///
    /// The intended use case of \c allocate() with the \c MemorySegmentGrown
    /// exception is to build a complex object that would internally require
    /// multiple calls to \c allocate():
    ///
    /// \code
    /// ComplicatedStuff* stuff = NULL;
    /// while (!stuff) { // this must eventually succeed or result in bad_alloc
    ///     try {
    ///         // create() is a factory method that takes a memory segment
    ///         // and calls allocate() on it multiple times.  create()
    ///         // provides an exception guarantee that any intermediately
    ///         // allocated memory will be properly deallocate()-ed on
    ///         // exception.
    ///         stuff = ComplicatedStuff::create(mem_segment);
    ///     } catch (const MemorySegmentGrown&) { /* just try again */ }

    /// always succeeds.

    /// version of this method with a way to tell the caller the reason of
    /// any failure (whether it's really out of memory or just due to growing
    /// the segment).  That would be more convenient if the caller wants to
    /// deal with the failures on a per-call basis rather than as a set
    /// of calls like in the above example.  At the moment, we don't expect

    /// it's not an API requirement.  It's generally the caller's
    /// responsibility to meet the restriction.  Note that NULL is allowed
    /// as \c addr even if it wouldn't be considered to "belong to" the
    /// segment in its normal sense; it can be used to indicate that memory
    /// has not been allocated for the specified name.  A subsequent call

    /// segment is not sufficient to allocate a space (if not already exist)
    /// for the specified name in the segment.  In that case, if possible, the

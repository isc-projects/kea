    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>
    <para>
      The <command>b10-dbutil</command> utility is a general administration
      utility for SQL databases. (Currently only SQLite is supported by
      BIND 10.)  It can report the current verion of the schema, and upgrade
      an existing database to the latest version of the schema.
    </para>

    <para>
      <command>b10-dbutil</command> operates in one of two modes, check mode
      or upgrade mode.
    </para>

    <para>
      In check mode (<command>b10-dbutil --check</command>), the
      utility reads the version of the database schema from the database
      and prints it.  It will tell you whether the schema is at the latest
      version supported by BIND 10. Exit status is 0 if the schema is at
      the correct version, 1 if the schema is at an older version, 2 if
      the schema is at a version not yet supported by this version of
      b10-dbutil. Any higher value indicates an error during command-line
      parsing or execution.
    </para>

    <para>
      When the upgrade function is selected
      (<command>b10-dbutil --upgrade</command>), the
      utility takes a copy of the database, then upgrades it to the latest
      version of the schema.  The contents of the database remain intact.
      (The backup file is a file in the same directory as the database
      file.  It has the same name, with ".backup" appended to it.  If a
      file of that name already exists, the file will have the suffix
      ".backup-1".  If that exists, the file will be suffixed ".backup-2",
      and so on). Exit status is 0 if the upgrade is either succesful or
      aborted by the user, and non-zero if there is an error.
    </para>

    <para>
    When upgrading the database, it is <emphasis>strongly</emphasis>
    recommended that BIND 10 not be running while the upgrade is in
    progress.

    <title>ARGUMENTS</title>

    <para>The arguments are as follows:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>
         <option>--check</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Selects the version check function, which reports the
          current version of the database.  This is incompatible
          with the --upgrade option.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
         <option>--noconfirm</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Only valid with --upgrade, this disables the prompt.
          Normally the utility will print a warning that an upgrade is
          about to take place and request that you type "Yes" to continue.
          If this switch is given on the command line, no prompt will
          be issued: the utility will just perform the upgrade.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>
         <option>--upgrade</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Selects the upgrade function, which upgrades the database
          to the latest version of the schema.  This is incompatible
          with the --upgrade option.
          </para>
          <para>
          The upgrade function will upgrade a BIND 10 database - no matter how
          old the schema - preserving all data.  A backup file is created
          before the upgrade (with the same name as the database, but with
          ".backup" suffixed to it).  If the upgrade fails, this file can
          be copied back to restore the original database.
          </para>

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Enable verbose mode.  Each SQL command issued by the
          utility will be printed to stderr before it is executed.</para>

        <term>
         <option>--quiet</option>

        <listitem>
          <para>Enable quiet mode. No output is printed, except errors during
            command-line argument parsing, or the user confirmation dialog.

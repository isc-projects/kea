/// @brief D2QueueMgr creates and manages a queue of DNS update requests.
///
/// D2QueueMgr is class specifically designed as an integral part of DHCP-DDNS.
/// Its primary responsibility is to listen for NameChangeRequests from
/// DHCP-DDNS clients (e.g. DHCP servers) and queue them for processing. In
/// addition it may provide a number services to locate entries in the queue
/// such as by FQDN or DHCID.  These services may eventually be used
/// for processing optimization.  The initial implementation will support
/// simple FIFO access.
///
/// D2QueueMgr uses a NameChangeListener to asynchronously receive requests.
/// It derives from NameChangeListener::RequestReceiveHandler and supplies an
/// implementation of the operator()(Result, NameChangeRequestPtr).  It is
/// through this operator() that D2QueueMgr is passed inbound NCRs. D2QueueMgr
/// will add each newly received request onto the back of the request queue
///
/// D2QueueMgr defines a simple state model constructed around the status of
/// its NameChangeListener, consisting of the following states:
///
///     * NOT_INITTED - D2QueueMgr has been constructed, but its listener has
///     not been initialized.
///
///     * INITTED - The listener has been initialized, but it is not open for
///     listening.   To move from NOT_INITTED to INITTED, one of the D2QueueMgr
///     listener initialization methods must be invoked.  Currently there is
///     only one type of listener, NameChangeUDPListener, hence there is only
///     one listener initialization method, initUDPListener.  As more listener
///     types are created, listener initialization methods will need to be
///     added.
///
///     * RUNNING - The listener is open and listening for requests.
///     Once initialized, in order to begin listening for requests, the
///     startListener() method must be invoked.  Upon successful completion of
///     of this call, D2QueueMgr will begin receiving requests as they arrive
///     without any further steps.   This method may be called from the INITTED
///     or one of the STOPPED states.
///
///     * STOPPING - The listener is in the process of stopping active
///     listening. This is transitory state between RUNNING and STOPPED, which
///     is completed by IO cancellation event.
///
///     * STOPPED - The listener has been listening but has been stopped
///     without error. To return to listening, startListener() must be invoked.
///
///     * STOPPED_QUEUE_FULL - Request queue is full, the listener has been
///     stopped.  D2QueueMgr will enter this state when the request queue
///     reaches the maximum queue size.  Once this limit is reached, the
///     listener will be closed and no further requests will be received.
///     To return to listening, startListener() must be invoked.  Note that so
///     long as the queue is full, any attempt to queue a request will fail.
///
///     * STOPPED_RECV_ERROR - The listener has experienced a receive error
///     and has been stopped.  D2QueueMgr will enter this state when it is
///     passed a failed status into the request completion handler.  To return
///     to listening, startListener() must be invoked.
///
/// D2QueueMgr does not attempt to recover from stopped conditions, this is left
/// to upper layers.
///
/// It is important to note that the queue contents are preserved between
/// state transitions.  In other words entries in the queue remain there
/// until they are removed explicitly via the deque() or implicitly by
/// via the clearQueue() method.

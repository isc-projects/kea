// identifier will be used as link layer address component of the DUID.
// The link layer type will be ethernet. The value of time is set to 0
// which indicates that the server must generate this value, i.e. use
// current time. Note that it is easy to move from this configuration
// to DUID-EN or DUID-LL. It would require changing the "type" value
// to "EN" or "LL" respectively. The "identifier" would hold a
// DUID-EN variable length identifier or DUID-LL link layer address.
// The values of "time" and "htype" would be ignored for DUID-EN.
// If one wanted to use a non-default enterprise-id for DUID-EN, the
// "enterprise-id" parameter would need to be added. Note that only
// a "type" parameter is mandatory while specifying "server-id" map.

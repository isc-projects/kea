/// the testing done on the base class.  These tests are sufficient to ensure
/// that D2Controller properly derives from its base class and to test the
/// logic that is unique to D2Controller. These tests will be augmented and
/// or new tests added as additional functionality evolves.

/// conditions as this is production code.

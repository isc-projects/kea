    <section xml:id="class-cmds-library">
      <title>class_cmds: Class Commands</title>
      <para>
        This section describes the Class Commands hooks library, which exposes
        several control commands for manipulating client classes (part of
        the Kea DHCP servers' configurations) without the need to restart those
        servers. Using these commands it is possible to add, update, delete, and
        list client classes configured for a given server.

        <note>
          <para>This library may only be loaded by the <command>kea-dhcp4</command>
          or the <command>kea-dhcp6</command> process.
          </para>
        </note>

        <para>The Class Commands hooks library is available to premium Kea
        customers only.</para>
      </para>

      <section xml:id="command-class-add">
        <title>class-add Command</title>
        <para>The <command>class-add</command> command adds a new client
        class to the DHCP server configuration. This class is appended at the
        end of the list of classes used by the server and may depend
        on any of the already configured client classes.</para>
        <para>The following example demonstrates how to add a new client class
        to the DHCPv4 server configuration:
<screen>
{
    "command": "class-add",
    "arguments": {
        "client-classes": [
            {
                "name": "ipxe_efi_x64",
                "test": "option[93].hex == 0x0009",
                "next-server": "192.0.2.254",
                "server-hostname": "hal9000",
                "boot-file-name": "/dev/null"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that the <command>client-classes</command> parameter is a JSON list,
          but it allows only a single client class to be present.
        </para>

        <para>
          Here is the response to the <command>class-add</command>
          command in our example:
<screen>
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "Class 'ipxe_efi_x64' added."
}
</screen>
        </para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="command-class-update">
        <title>class-update Command</title>
        <para>
          The <command>class-update</command> command updates an existing
          client class in the DHCP server configuration. If the client class with the
          given name doesn't exist, the server returns the result code of 3, which means that
          the server configuration is not modified and the client class does not exist. The
          <command>class-add</command> command must be used instead to create the new
          client class.
        </para>
        <para>
          The <command>class-update</command> command has the same argument structure
          as the <command>class-add</command> command:
<screen>
{
    "command": "class-update",
    "arguments": {
        "client-classes": [
            {
                "name": "ipxe_efi_x64",
                "test": "option[93].hex == 0x0017",
                "next-server": "0.0.0.0",
                "server-hostname": "xfce",
                "boot-file-name": "/dev/null"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Here is the response for our example:
<screen>
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "Class 'ipxe_efi_x64' updated."
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Any parameter of the client class can be modified with this command, except
          <command>name</command>. There is currently no way to rename the class,
          because the class name is used as a key for searching the class to be updated.
          To achieve a similar effect to renaming the class, an existing class
          can be removed with the <command>class-del</command> command and then added
          again with a different name using <command>class-add</command>. Note, however,
          that the class with the new name will be added at the end of the list of
          configured classes.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="command-class-del">
        <title>class-del Command</title>
        <para>The <command>class-del</command> is used to remove a particular class
        from the server configuration. The class to be removed is identified by name.
        The class is not removed if there are other classes depending on it;
        to remove such a class, the dependent classes must be removed first.</para>
        <para>The following is a sample command removing the
        <command>ipxe_efi_x64</command> class:
<screen>
{
    "command": "class-del",
    "arguments": {
        {
            "name": "ipxe_efi_x64"
        }
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>Here is the response to the <command>class-del</command>
        command in our example, when the specified client class has been found:
<screen>
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "Class 'ipxe_efi_x64' deleted."
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>If the class doesn't exist, the result of 3 is returned.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="command-class-list">
        <title>class-list Command</title>
        <para><command>class-list</command> is used to retrieve a list of all
        client classes. This command includes no arguments:
<screen>
{
    "command": "class-list"
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Here is the response of the server in our example, including the list
          of client classes:
<screen>
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "2 classes found",
    "arguments": {
        "client-classes": [
            {
                "name": "ipxe_efi_x64"
            },
            {
                "name": "pxeclient"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that the returned list does not contain full class definitions, but
          merely class names. To retrieve full class information, the
          <command>class-get</command> command should be used.
        </para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="command-class-get">
        <title>class-get Command</title>
        <para><command>class-get</command> is used to retrieve detailed information
        about a specified class. The command structure is very simple:
<screen>
{
    "command": "class-get",
    "arguments": {
        "name": "pxeclient"
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          If the class with the specified name does not exist, the status code of 3
          is returned. If the specified client class exists, the class details are
          returned in the following format:
<screen>
{
    "result": 0,
    "text": "Class 'pxeclient' definition returned",
    "arguments": {
        "client-classes": [
            {
                "name": "pxeclient",
                "only-if-required": true,
                "test": "option[vendor-class-identifier].text == 'PXEClient'",
                "option-def": [
                    {
                        "name": "configfile",
                        "code": 209,
                        "type": "string"
                    }
                ],
                "option-data": [ ],
                "next-server": "0.0.0.0",
                "server-hostname": "xfce",
                "boot-file-name": "/dev/null"
            }
        ]
    }
}
</screen>
        </para>
        <para>
          Note that the example above is DHCPv4-specific; the last three parameters
          are only returned by the DHCPv4 server and are never returned by the DHCPv6
          server. Also, some of the parameters provided in this example may not be
          returned if they are not specified for the class. Specifically,
          <command>only-if-required</command>, <command>test</command>, and
          <command>option-def</command> are not returned if they are not specified
          for the class.

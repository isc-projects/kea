# Addresses will be assigned with valid lifetimes being 4000. Client
# is told to start renewing after 1000 seconds. If the server does not respond

# to start REBIND procedure (emergency renewal that allows switching
# to a different server).

# Renew and rebind timers are commented out. This implies that options

# Kea supports several reservations by several different types of identifiers:
# hw-address (hardware/MAC address of the client), duid (DUID inserted by the
# client), client-id (client identifier inserted by the client) and circuit-id
# (circuit identifier inserted by the relay agent). When told to do so, Kea can
# check for all of those identifier types, but it takes a costly database lookup
# to do so. It is therefore useful from performance perspective to use only
# that reservation types that are actually used in a given network.

# This example below is not the best from performance perspective, but it
# showcases the capabilities nicely. Please use the minimum set of identifier
# types used in your network.

# Define a subnet with four reservations. Some of the reservations belong
# to the dynamic pool. Kea is able to handle this case, but it is not
# recommended from performance perspective, as Kea would not only need to
# check if given address is free, but also whether it is reserved for anyone.
# To avoid this check, one change reservation-mode to out-of-pool, rather
# than 'all'. If a subnet does not have reservations at all, the reservation
# lookup can be skipped altogether (reservation-mode set to 'disabled').

# Note that the second reservation is for the address which is within the
# range of the pool of the dynamically allocated address. The server will
# exclude this address from this pool and only assign it to the client which
# has a reservation for it.

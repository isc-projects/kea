# This is the Kea schema specification for MySQL.
#
# The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of the engine
# specification, which is MySQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed for
# other databases.

# To create the schema, either type the command:
#
# mysql -u <user> -p <password> <database> < dhcpdb_create.mysql
# # ... at the command prompt, or log in to the MySQL database and at the 'mysql>'
# prompt, issue the command:
#
# source dhcpdb_create.mysql
#
# This script is also called from kea-admin, see kea-admin db-init mysql
#
# Over time, Kea database schema will evolve. Each version is marked with
# major.minor version. This file is organized sequentially, i.e. database
# is initialized to 1.0, then upgraded to 2.0 etc. This may be somewhat
# sub-optimal, but it ensues consistency with upgrade scripts. (It is much
# easier to maintain init and upgrade scripts if they look the same).
# Since initialization is done only once, it's performance is not an issue.

# This line starts database initialization to 1.0.

--
-- Parameters:

--   revision.
-- - server_tag is used to retrieve the server_id which
--   associates the changes applied with the particular
--   server or all servers.
-- - audit_log_message is a log message associates with
--   the audit revision.
-- - cascade_transaction is assigned to a session
--   variable which is used in some triggers to determine
--   if the audit entry should be created for them or
--   not. Specifically, this is used when DHCP options
--   are inserted, updated or deleted. If such modification
--   is a part of the larger change (e.g. change in the

--   it is the sole object modified in that case.

--   the procedure when wiping the database during
--   unit tests.  This avoids issues with revision_id

-- - cascade_transaction is assigned to a session

--   are inserted, updated or deleted. If such modification

# Notes:
#
# Indexes
# =======
# It is likely that additional indexes will be needed.  However, the
# increase in lookup performance from these will come at the expense
# of a decrease in performance during insert operations due to the need
# to update the indexes.  For this reason, the need for additional indexes
# will be determined by experiment during performance tests.
#
# The most likely additional indexes will cover the following columns:
#
# hwaddr and client_id
# For lease stability: if a client requests a new lease, try to find an
# existing or recently expired lease for it so that it can keep using the
# same IP address.
#
# Field Sizes
# ===========
# If any of the VARxxx field sizes are altered, the lengths in the MySQL
# backend source file (mysql_lease_mgr.cc) must be correspondingly changed.
#
# Portability
# ===========
# The 'ENGINE = INNODB' on some tables is not portable to another database
# and will need to be removed.
#
# Some columns contain binary data so are stored as VARBINARY instead of
# VARCHAR.  This may be non-portable between databases: in this case, the
# definition should be changed to VARCHAR.

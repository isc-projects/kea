    /// Unlike the case of some other RDATA classes (such as

    /// internally maintained in the class (which is a private member).
    /// This is based on the observation that this method will be rarely used
    /// and even when it's used it will not be in a performance context
    /// (for example, a recursive resolver won't need this field in its
    /// resolution process).  By returning a new object we have flexibility of
    /// changing the internal representation without the risk of changing
    /// the interface or method property.
    /// The same note applies to the \c getText() method.

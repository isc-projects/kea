# \brief Messages for the data source memory library

% DATASRC_MEMORY_BAD_NSEC3_NAME NSEC3 record has a bad owner name '%1'
The software refuses to load NSEC3 records into a wildcard domain or
the owner name has two or more labels below the zone origin.
It isn't explicitly forbidden, but no sane zone wouldn have such names
for NSEC3.  BIND 9 also refuses NSEC3 at wildcard, so this behavior is
compatible with BIND 9.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_CHECK_ERROR post-load check of zone %1/%2 failed: %3
The zone was loaded into the data source successfully, but the content fails
basic sanity checks. See the message if you want to know what exactly is wrong
with the data. The data can not be used and previous version, if any, will be
preserved.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_CHECK_WARNING %1/%2: %3
The zone was loaded into the data source successfully, but there's some problem
with the content. The problem does not stop the new version from being used
(though there may be other problems that do, see DATASRC_MEMORY_CHECK_ERROR),
but it should still be checked and fixed. See the message to know what exactly
is wrong with the data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_ADD_RRSET adding RRset '%1/%2' into zone '%3'
Debug information. An RRset is being added to the in-memory data source.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_ADD_WILDCARD adding wildcards for '%1'
This is a debug message issued during the processing of a wildcard
name. The internal domain name tree is scanned and some nodes are
specially marked to allow the wildcard lookup to succeed.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_ADD_ZONE adding zone '%1/%2'
Debug information. A zone is being added into the in-memory data source.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_CNAME_COEXIST can't add data to CNAME in domain '%1'
This is the same problem as in MEM_CNAME_TO_NONEMPTY, but it happened the
other way around -- adding some other data to CNAME.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_CNAME_TO_NONEMPTY can't add CNAME to domain with other data in '%1'
Someone or something tried to add a CNAME into a domain that already contains
some other data. But the protocol forbids coexistence of CNAME with anything
(RFC 1034, section 3.6.2). This indicates a problem with provided data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_DNAME_NS DNAME and NS can't coexist in non-apex domain '%1'
A request was made for DNAME and NS records to be put into the same
domain which is not the apex (the top of the zone). This is forbidden
by RFC 2672 (section 3) and indicates a problem with provided data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_DUP_RRSET duplicate RRset '%1/%2'
An RRset is being inserted into in-memory data source for a second time.  The
original version must be removed first. Note that loading master files where an
RRset is split into multiple locations is not supported yet.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_FIND_ZONE looking for zone '%1'
Debug information. A zone object for this zone is being searched for in the
in-memory data source.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_LOAD loading zone '%1' from file '%2'
Debug information. The content of master file is being loaded into the memory.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_NO_NSEC3PARAM NSEC3PARAM is missing for NSEC3-signed zone %1/%2
The in-memory data source has loaded a zone signed with NSEC3 RRs,
but it doesn't have a NSEC3PARAM RR at the zone origin.  It's likely that
the zone is somehow broken, but this RR is not necessarily needed for
handling lookups with NSEC3 in this data source, so it accepts the given
content of the zone.  Nevertheless the administrator should look into
the integrity of the zone data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_OUT_OF_ZONE domain '%1' doesn't belong to zone '%2'
It was attempted to add the domain into a zone that shouldn't have it
(eg. the domain is not subdomain of the zone origin). This indicates a
problem with provided data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_SINGLETON trying to add multiple RRs for domain '%1' and type '%2'
Some resource types are singletons -- only one is allowed in a domain
(for example CNAME or SOA). This indicates a problem with provided data.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_WILDCARD_DNAME DNAME record in wildcard domain '%1'
The software refuses to load DNAME records into a wildcard domain.  It isn't
explicitly forbidden, but the protocol is ambiguous about how this should
behave and BIND 9 refuses that as well. Please describe your intention using
different tools.

% DATASRC_MEMORY_MEM_WILDCARD_NS NS record in wildcard domain '%1'
The software refuses to load NS records into a wildcard domain.  It isn't
explicitly forbidden, but the protocol is ambiguous about how this should
behave and BIND 9 refuses that as well. Please describe your intention using
different tools.

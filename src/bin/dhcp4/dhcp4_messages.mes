% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTED control channel session started on socket %1
A debug message issued during startup after the IPv4 DHCP server has
successfully established a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_CCSESSION_STARTING starting control channel session, specfile: %1
This debug message is issued just before the IPv4 DHCP server attempts
to establish a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP4_COMMAND_RECEIVED received command %1, arguments: %2
A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND 10 control system by the IPv4 DHCP server.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL failed to load configuration: %1
This critical error message indicates that the initial DHCPv4
configuration has failed. The server will start, but nothing will be
served until the configuration has been corrected.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_NEW_SUBNET A new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified IPv4 subnet.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_OPTION_DUPLICATE multiple options with the code %1 added to the subnet %2
This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options
with the same option code for a particular subnet. Adding multiple options
is uncommon for DHCPv4, but is not prohibited.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_UPDATE updated configuration received: %1
A debug message indicating that the IPv4 DHCP server has received an
updated configuration from the BIND 10 configuration system.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_START DHCPv4 server is processing the following configuration: %1
This is a debug message that is issued every time the server receives a
configuration. That happens at start up and also when a server configuration
change is committed by the administrator.

% DHCP4_CONFIG_COMPLETE DHCPv4 server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. It is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DHCP4_DB_BACKEND_STARTED lease database started (type: %1, name: %2)
This informational message is printed every time DHCPv4 server is started
and gives both the type and name of the database being used to store
lease and other information.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT lease %1 advertised (client client-id %2, hwaddr %3)
This debug message indicates that the server successfully advertised
a lease. It is up to the client to choose one server out of othe advertised
and continue allocation with that server. This is a normal behavior and
indicates successful operation.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT_FAIL failed to advertise a lease for client client-id %1, hwaddr %2
This message indicates that the server has failed to offer a lease to
the specified client after receiving a DISCOVER message from it. There are
many possible reasons for such a failure.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC lease %1 has been allocated for client-id %2, hwaddr %3
This debug message indicates that the server successfully granted a lease
in response to client's REQUEST message. This is a normal behavior and
incicates successful operation.

% DHCP4_LEASE_ALLOC_FAIL failed to grant a lease for client-id %1, hwaddr %2
This message indicates that the server failed to grant a lease to the
specified client after receiving a REQUEST message from it.  There are many
possible reasons for such a failure. Additional messages will indicate the
reason.

% DHCP4_NOT_RUNNING IPv4 DHCP server is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
IPv4 DHCP server but it is not running.

% DHCP4_OPEN_SOCKET opening sockets on port %1
A debug message issued during startup, this indicates that the IPv4 DHCP
server is about to open sockets on the specified port.

% DHCP4_PACKET_PARSE_FAIL failed to parse incoming packet: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server has received a packet that it is unable to
interpret. The reason why the packet is invalid is included in the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_PROCESS_FAIL failed to process received packet: %1
This is a general catch-all message indicating that the processing of a
received packet failed.  The reason is given in the message.  The server
will not send a response but will instead ignore the packet.

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVED %1 (type %2) packet received on interface %3
A debug message noting that the server has received the specified type of
packet on the specified interface.  Note that a packet marked as UNKNOWN
may well be a valid DHCP packet, just a type not expected by the server
(e.g. it will report a received OFFER packet as UNKNOWN).

% DHCP4_PACKET_RECEIVE_FAIL error on attempt to receive packet: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server tried to receive a packet but an error
occurred during this attempt. The reason for the error is included in
the message.

% DHCP4_PACKET_SEND_FAIL failed to send DHCPv4 packet: %1
This error is output if the IPv4 DHCP server fails to send an assembled
DHCP message to a client. The reason for the error is included in the
message.

% DHCP4_PACK_FAIL failed to assemble response correctly
This error is output if the server failed to assemble the data to be
returned to the client into a valid packet.  The cause is most likely
to be a programming error: please raise a bug report.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_EXCEPTION parser failed to commit changes
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv4 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but one
of them failed to commit its changes due to a low-level system exception
being raised.  Additional messages may be output indicating the reason.

% DHCP4_PARSER_COMMIT_FAIL parser failed to commit changes: %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv4 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but
one of them failed to commit its changes.  The reason for the failure
is given in the message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_CREATED created parser for configuration element %1
A debug message output during a configuration update of the IPv4 DHCP
server, notifying that the parser for the specified configuration element
has been successfully created.

% DHCP4_PARSER_FAIL failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv4 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents
of the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the
parsing actions and committal of changes failed.  The reason for the
failure is given in the message.

% DHCP4_PARSER_EXCEPTION failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv4 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of
the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the parsing
actions and committal of changes failed.  The message has been output in
response to a non-BIND 10 exception being raised.  Additional messages
may give further information.

% DHCP4_QUERY_DATA received packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data received from the client.

% DHCP4_RELEASE address %1 belonging to client-id %2, hwaddr %3 was released properly.
This debug message indicates that an address was released properly. It
is a normal operation during client shutdown.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_EXCEPTION exception %1 while trying to release address %2
This message is output when an error was encountered during an attempt
to process a RELEASE message. The error will not affect the client,
which does not expect any response from the server for RELEASE
messages. Depending on the nature of problem, it may affect future
server operation.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL failed to remove lease for address %1 for duid %2, hwaddr %3
This error message indicates that the software failed to remove a
lease from the lease database. It is probably due to an error during a
database operation: resolution will most likely require administrator
intervention (e.g. check if DHCP process has sufficient privileges to
update the database). It may also be triggered if a lease was manually
removed from the database during RELEASE message processing.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_NO_LEASE client (client-id %2) tried to release address %1, but there is no lease for such address.
This warning message is printed when client attempts to release a lease,
but no such lease is known to the server.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_CLIENT_ID client (client-id %2) tried to release address %1, but it belongs to client (client-id %3)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that belongs to a different client. This should not happen in normal
circumstances and may indicate a misconfiguration of the client.  However,
since the client releasing the address will stop using it anyway, there
is a good chance that the situation will correct itself.

% DHCP4_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_HWADDR client (client-id %2) tried to release address %1, but sent from a wrong hardware address (%3)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that does belong to it, but the lease information was associated with
a different hardware address. One possible reason for using different
hardware address is that a cloned virtual machine was not updated and
both clones use the same client-id.

% DHCP4_RESPONSE_DATA responding with packet type %1, data is <%2>
A debug message listing the data returned to the client.

% DHCP4_SERVER_FAILED server failed: %1
The IPv4 DHCP server has encountered a fatal error and is terminating.
The reason for the failure is included in the message.

% DHCP4_SERVERID_GENERATED server-id %1 has been generated and will be stored in %2
This informational messages indicates that the server was not able to
read its server identifier and has generated a new one. This server-id
will be stored in a file and will be read (and used) whenever the server
is restarted. This is normal behavior when the server is started for the
first time. If this message is printed every time the server is started,
please check that the server has sufficient permission to write its
server-id file and that the file is not corrupt.

% DHCP4_SERVERID_LOADED server-id %1 has been loaded from file %2
This debug message indicates that the server loaded its server identifier.
That value is sent in all server responses and clients use it to
discriminate between servers. This is a part of normal startup or
reconfiguration procedure.

% DHCP4_SERVERID_WRITE_FAIL server was not able to write its ID to file %1
This warning message indicates that server was not able to write its
server identifier to a file. The most likely cause is is that the server
does not have permissions to write the server id file.

% DHCP4_SESSION_FAIL failed to establish BIND 10 session (%1), running stand-alone
The server has failed to establish communication with the rest of BIND
10 and is running in stand-alone mode.  (This behavior will change once
the IPv4 DHCP server is properly integrated with the rest of BIND 10.)

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN server shutdown
The IPv4 DHCP server has terminated normally.

% DHCP4_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST shutdown of server requested
This debug message indicates that a shutdown of the IPv4 server has
been requested via a call to the 'shutdown' method of the core Dhcpv4Srv
object.

% DHCP4_SRV_CONSTRUCT_ERROR error creating Dhcpv4Srv object, reason: %1
This error message indicates that during startup, the construction of a
core component within the IPv4 DHCP server (the Dhcpv4 server object)
has failed.  As a result, the server will exit.  The reason for the
failure is given within the message.

% DHCP4_STANDALONE skipping message queue, running standalone
This is a debug message indicating that the IPv4 server is running in
standalone mode, not connected to the message queue.  Standalone mode
is only useful during program development, and should not be used in a
production environment.

% DHCP4_STARTING server starting
This informational message indicates that the IPv4 DHCP server has
processed any command-line switches and is starting.

% DHCP4_START_INFO pid: %1, port: %2, verbose: %3, standalone: %4
This is a debug message issued during the IPv4 DHCP server startup.
It lists some information about the parameters with which the server
is running.

% DHCP4_SUBNET_SELECTED the %1 subnet was selected for client assignment
This is a debug message noting the selection of a subnet to be used for
address and option assignment.  Subnet selection is one of the early
steps in the processing of incoming client message.

% DHCP4_SUBNET_SELECTION_FAILED failed to select a subnet for incoming packet, src: %1, type: %2
This warning message is output when a packet was received from a subnet
for which the DHCPv4 server has not been configured. The most probable
cause is a misconfiguration of the server.

/// @brief This file defines abstract classes for exchanging NameChangeRequests.
///
/// These classes are used for sending and receiving requests to update DNS
/// information for FQDNs embodied as NameChangeRequests (aka NCRs). Ultimately,
/// NCRs must move through the following three layers in order to implement
/// DHCP-DDNS:
///
///    * Application layer - the business layer which needs to
///    transport NameChangeRequests, and is unaware of the means by which
///    they are transported.
///
///    * NameChangeRequest layer - This is the layer which acts as the
///    intermediary between the Application layer and the IO layer.  It must
///    be able to move NameChangeRequests to the IO layer as raw data and move
///    raw data from the IO layer in the Application layer as
///    NameChangeRequests.
///
///    * IO layer - the low-level layer that is directly responsible for
///    sending and receiving data asynchronously and is supplied through
///    other libraries.  This layer is largely unaware of the nature of the
///    data being transmitted.  In other words, it doesn't know beans about
///    NCRs.
///
/// The abstract classes defined here implement the latter, middle layer,
/// the NameChangeRequest layer.  There are two types of participants in this
/// middle ground:
///
///    * listeners - Receive NCRs from one or more sources. The DHCP-DDNS
///   application, (aka D2), is a listener. Listeners are embodied by the
///   class, NameChangeListener.
///
///    * senders - sends NCRs to a given target.  DHCP servers are senders.
///   Senders are embodied by the class, NameChangeSender.
///
/// These two classes present a public interface for asynchronous
/// communications that is independent of the IO layer mechanisms.  While the
/// type and details of the IO mechanism are not relevant to either class, it
/// is presumed to use isc::asiolink library for asynchronous event processing.

/// @brief Abstract interface for receiving NameChangeRequests.
///
/// NameChangeListener provides the means to:
/// -  Supply a callback to invoke upon receipt of an NCR or a listening
/// error
/// -  Start listening using a given IOService instance to process events
/// -  Stop listening
///
/// It implements the high level logic flow to listen until a request arrives,
/// invoke the implementation's handler and return to listening for the next
/// request.
///
/// It provides virtual methods that allow derivations supply implementations
/// to open the appropriate IO source, perform a listen, and close the IO
/// source.
///
/// The overall design is based on a callback chain. The listener's caller (the
/// application) supplies an "application" layer callback through which it will
/// receive inbound NameChangeRequests.  The listener derivation will supply
/// its own callback to the IO layer to process receive events from its IO
/// source.  This is referred to as the NameChangeRequest completion handler.
/// It is through this handler that the NameChangeRequest layer gains access
/// to the low level IO read service results.  It is expected to assemble
/// NameChangeRequests from the inbound data and forward them to the
/// application layer by invoking the application layer callback registered
/// with the listener.
///
/// The application layer callback is structured around a nested class,
/// RequestReceiveHandler.  It consists of single, abstract operator() which
/// accepts a result code and a pointer to a NameChangeRequest as parameters.
/// In order to receive inbound NCRs, a caller implements a derivation of the
/// RequestReceiveHandler and supplies an instance of this derivation to the
/// NameChangeListener constructor. This "registers" the handler with the
/// listener.
///
/// To begin listening, the caller invokes the listener's startListener()
/// method, passing in an IOService instance.  This in turn will pass the
/// IOService into the virtual method, open().  The open method is where the
/// listener derivation performs the steps necessary to prepare its IO source
/// for reception (e.g. opening a socket, connecting to a database).
///
/// Assuming the open is successful, startListener will call receiveNext, to
/// initiate an asynchronous receive.  This method calls the virtual method,
/// doReceive().  The listener derivation uses doReceive to instigate an IO
/// layer asynchronous receive passing in its IO layer callback to
/// handle receive events from the IO source.
///
/// As stated earlier, the derivation's NameChangeRequest completion handler
/// MUST invoke the application layer handler registered with the listener.
/// This is done by passing in either a success status and a populated
/// NameChangeRequest or an error status and an empty request into the
/// listener's invokeRecvHandler method. This is the mechanism by which the

  <title>Lease Expiration in DHCPv4 and DHCPv6</title>

  <para>The primary role of the DHCP server is to assign addresses and/or
  delegate prefixes to DHCP clients. These addresses and prefixes are
  often referred to as "leases." Leases are typically assigned to clients
  for a finite amount of time, known as the "valid lifetime." DHCP clients who
  wish to continue using their assigned leases will periodically renew them
  by sending the appropriate message to the DHCP server. The DHCP server records
  the time when these leases are renewed and calculates new expiration times
  for them.
  </para>

  <para>If the client does not renew a lease before its valid lifetime
  elapses, the lease is considered expired. There are many situations
  when the client may cease lease renewals; a common scenario is when
  the machine running the client shuts down for an extended period of
  time.</para>

  <para> The process through which the DHCP server makes expired leases
  available for reassignment is referred to as "lease reclamation" and expired
  leases returned to availability through this process are referred to as
  "reclaimed."
  The DHCP server attempts to reclaim an expired lease as soon as it detects
  that it has expired. The server has several possible ways to detect expiration:
  it may attempt to allocate a lease to a client but find this
  lease already present in the database and expired; or it can
  periodically query the lease
  database for expired leases. Regardless of how an expired lease is detected, it must be
  reclaimed before it can be assigned to a client.
  </para>
  <para>
  This chapter explains how to configure the server to periodically query
  for the expired leases, and how to minimize the impact of the periodic lease
  reclamation process on the server's responsiveness. Finally, it explains
  "lease affinity," which provides the means to assign the same lease to a
  returning client after its lease has expired.
  </para>

  <para>Although all configuration examples in this section are provided
  for the DHCPv4 server, the same parameters may be used for
  DHCPv6 server configuration.

  <section xml:id="lease-reclaim-config">
    <title>Configuring Lease Reclamation</title>
    <para>Kea can be configured to periodically detect and reclaim expired
    leases. During this process the lease entries in the database are
    modified or removed. While this is happening, the server will not process incoming DHCP
    messages to avoid issues with concurrent access to database information.
    As a result, the server will be unresponsive while lease reclamation
    is performed and DHCP queries will accumulate; responses will be
    sent once the lease-reclamation cycle is complete.</para>

    <para>In deployments where response time is critical, administrators may
    wish to minimize the interruptions in service caused by lease reclamation.
    Toward this end, Kea provides configuration parameters to control the
    frequency of lease reclamation cycles, the maximum number of leases
    processed in a single reclamation cycle, and the maximum amount of time a
    single reclamation cycle is allowed to run before being interrupted. The
    following examples demonstrate how these parameters can be used:

<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 5,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 0,
        "max-reclaim-time": 0,
    },

    ...
}
</screen>
    </para>

    <para>The first parameter is expressed in seconds and specifies an
    interval between the two consecutive lease reclamation cycles. This
    is explained by the following diagram:

<screen>

|  c1  |            | c2 |            |c3|            | c4 |
|&lt;----&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;&gt;|&lt;----------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|
----------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|      |     5s     |    |     5s     |  |     5s     |    | time

</screen>

    </para>
    <para>This diagram shows four lease-reclamation cycles (c1 through c4) of variable duration.
    Note that the duration of the reclamation cycle depends on the number
    of expired leases detected and processed in the particular cycle. This
    duration is usually significantly shorter than the interval between
    the cycles.
    </para>

    <para>According to the <command>reclaim-timer-wait-time</command>, the
    server keeps fixed intervals of five seconds between the end of one cycle
    and the start of the next cycle. This guarantees the presence of
    5s-long periods during which the server remains responsive to DHCP
    queries and does not perform lease reclamation. The
    <command>max-reclaim-leases</command> and
    <command>max-reclaim-time</command> are set to 0, which sets
    no restriction on the maximum number of leases reclaimed
    in the particular cycle, or on the maximum duration of each cycle.
    </para>

    <para>In deployments with high lease-pool utilization, relatively
    short valid lifetimes, and frequently disconnecting clients which
    allow leases to expire, the number of expired leases requiring reclamation
    at any given time may rise significantly. In this case, it is often
    desirable to apply restrictions to the maximum duration of a reclamation
    cycle or the maximum number of leases reclaimed in a cycle. The following
    configuration demonstrates how this can be done:

<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "max-reclaim-leases": 100,
        "max-reclaim-time": 50,
        "unwarned-reclaim-cycles": 10,
    },

    ...
}</screen>

    </para>

    <para>The <command>max-reclaim-leases</command> parameter limits the number
    of leases reclaimed in a single cycle to 100. The
    <command>max-reclaim-time</command> limits the maximum duration of each
    cycle to 50ms. The lease-reclamation cycle will be interrupted if either
    of these limitations is reached. The reclamation of any unreclaimed
    leases will be attempted in subsequent cycles.</para>

    <para>The following diagram illustrates the behavior of the system in the
    presence of many expired leases, when the limits are applied for the
    reclamation cycles:

<screen>

| c1 |                | c2 |                | c3 |                | c4 |
|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--------------&gt;|&lt;--&gt;|&lt;--
------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;
|50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|       3s       |50ms|  time

</screen>

    </para>

    <para>This diagram demonstrates the case when each reclamation cycle takes
    more than 50ms, and thus is interrupted according to the value of the
    <command>max-reclaim-time</command>. This results in equal durations of
    all reclamation cycles over time. Note that in this example the limitation
    of the maximum 100 leases is not reached. This may be the case when database
    transactions are slow or callouts in the hook libraries attached to
    the server are slow. Regardless, the chosen values for either the
    maximum number of leases or a maximum cycle time strongly depend on the
    particular deployment, the lease database backend being used, and any hooks
    libraries, etc. Administrators may need to experiment to tune the system
    to suit the dynamics of their deployment.</para>

    <para>It is important to realize that with the use of these limits, there
    is a risk that expired leases will accumulate faster than the server can
    reclaim them. This should not be a problem if the server is dealing
    with a temporary burst of expirations, because it should be able to
    eventually deal with them over time. However, if leases expire at a high
    rate for a longer period of time, the unreclaimed leases will pile up in
    the database. To notify the administrator that the current
    configuration does not satisfy the needs for reclamation of expired
    leases, the server issues a warning message in the log if it is unable
    to reclaim all leases within several reclamation cycles. The
    number of cycles after which such a warning is issued is specified with the
    <command>unwarned-reclaim-cycles</command> configuration parameter.
    </para>

    <para>Setting the <command>reclaim-timer-wait-time</command> to 0 disables
    periodic reclamation of the expired leases.</para>
  </section>

  <section xml:id="lease-affinity">
    <title>Configuring Lease Affinity</title>
    <para>Suppose that a laptop goes into sleep mode after a period of user
    inactivity. While the laptop is in sleep mode, its DHCP client will not
    renew leases obtained from the server and these leases will eventually
    expire. When the laptop wakes up, it is often desirable for it to continue
    using its previous assigned IP addresses. To facilitate this,
    the server needs to correlate returning clients with their expired leases.
    When the client returns, the server will first check for those leases and
    re-assign them if they have not been assigned to another client. The ability
    of the server to re-assign the same lease to a returning client is
    referred to as "lease affinity."
    </para>

    <para>When lease affinity is enabled (i.e. when
    <command>hold-reclaimed-time</command> is configured to a value
    greater than zero), the server will still
    reclaim leases according to the parameters described in
    <xref linkend="lease-reclaim-config"/>, but the reclaimed leases
    will be held in the database (rather than removed) for a specified
    amount of time. When the client returns, the server will first verify
    whether there are any reclaimed leases associated with this client and will
    re-assign them if possible. However, it is important to note that
    any reclaimed lease may be assigned to another client if that client
    specifically asks for it. Therefore, lease affinity does not
    guarantee that the reclaimed lease will be available for the client
    who used it before; it merely increases the chances for the client to
    be assigned the same lease. If the lease pool is small (this mostly applies
    to DHCPv4 for which address space is small), there is an increased
    likelihood that the expired lease will be assigned to another client.
    </para>

    <para>Consider the following configuration:

<screen>
"Dhcp4": {
    ...

    "expired-leases-processing": {
        "reclaim-timer-wait-time": 3,
        "hold-reclaimed-time": 1800,
        "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time": 5
    },

    ...
}
</screen>

    </para>

    <para>The <command>hold-reclaim-time</command> specifies how many seconds
    after an expiration a reclaimed lease should be held in the database
    for re-assignment to the same client. In the example given above,
    reclaimed leases will be held for 30 minutes (1800s) after their
    expiration. During this time, the server will likely be able to
    re-assign the same lease to the returning client, unless another client
    requests this lease and the server assigns it.</para>

    <para>The server must periodically remove reclaimed leases for which the
    time indicated by <command>hold-reclaim-time</command> has elapsed. The
    <command>flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time</command> parameter controls how
    often the server removes such leases. In the example provided
    above, the server will initiate removal of such leases 5 seconds after
    the previous removal attempt was completed. Setting this value to 0
    disables lease affinity, in which case leases will be removed from the
    lease database when they are reclaimed. If lease affinity is enabled, it
    is recommended that <command>hold-reclaim-time</command> be set to a value significantly
    higher than the <command>reclaim-timer-wait-time</command>, as timely
    removal of expired-reclaimed leases is less critical than the removal
    process, which may impact server responsiveness.</para>

    <para>There is no guarantee that lease affinity will work every
    time. If a server is running out of addresses, it will reassign
    expired addresses to new clients. Also, clients can request
    specific addresses and the server will try to honor such a request
    if possible. If you want to ensure a client keeps its address,
    even after periods of inactivity, consider using host reservations
    or leases with very long lifetimes.</para>

- rdatarender_bench

  This is a benchmark for RDATA rendering performance comparing the basic
  Rdata objects and RdataField objects.  It takes a command line argument
  that specifies an input data file.  Each line of the data file should
  specify a single RDATA with its RR class and type, e.g.
  IN A 192.0.2.1
  IN NS ns.example.com.
  Lines beginning with '#' and empty lines will be ignored.  Sample input
  files can be found in benchmarkdata/rdatarender_*.

/// idiom.
class AuthSrvImpl;

/// \brief The authoritative nameserver class.
///
/// \c AuthSrv is a concrete class that implements authoritative DNS server
/// protocol processing.
/// An \c AuthSrv object is primarily responsible for handling incoming DNS
/// requests: It parses the request and dispatches subsequent processing to
/// the corresponding module (which may be an internal library or a separate
/// process) depending on the request type.  For normal queries, the
/// \c AuthSrv object searches configured data sources for the answer to the
/// query, and builds a response containing the answer.
///
/// This class uses the "pimpl" idiom, and hides detailed implementation
/// through the \c impl_ pointer (which points to an instance of the
/// \c AuthSrvImpl class).  An \c AuthSrv object is supposed to exist for quite
/// a long period, and only a few \c AuthSrv objects will be created (in fact,
/// in this current implementation there will only be one object), so the
/// construction overhead of this approach should be acceptable.
///
/// The design of this class is still in flux.  It's quite likely to change
/// in future versions.
///

/// TSIG session context.
///
/// The \c TSIGContext class maintains a context of a signed session of
/// DNS transactions by TSIG.  In many cases a TSIG signed session consists
/// of a single set of request (e.g. normal query) and reply (e.g. normal
/// response), where the request is initially signed by the client, and the
/// reply is signed by the server using the initial signature.  As mentioned
/// in RFC2845, a session can consist of multiple exchanges in a TCP
/// connection.  As also mentioned in the RFC, an AXFR response often contains
/// multiple DNS messages, which can belong to the same TSIG session.
/// This class supports all these cases.
///
/// A \c TSIGContext object is generally constructed with a TSIG key to be
/// used for the session, and keeps track of various kinds of session specific
/// information, such as the original digest while waiting for a response or
/// verification error information that is to be used for a subsequent
/// response.
///
/// This class has two main methods, \c sign() and \c verify().
/// The \c sign() method signs given data (which is supposed to be a complete
/// DNS message without the TSIG itself) using the TSIG key and other
/// related information associated with the \c TSIGContext object.
/// The \c verify() method verifies a given DNS message that contains a TSIG
/// RR using the key and other internal information.
///
/// In general, a DNS client that wants to send a signed query will construct
/// a \c TSIGContext object with the TSIG key that the client is intending to
/// use, and sign the query with the context.  The client will keeps the
/// context, and verify the response with it.
///
/// On the other hand, a DNS server will construct a \c TSIGContext object
/// with the information of the TSIG RR included in a query with a set of
/// possible keys (in the form of a \c TSIGKeyRing object).  The constructor
/// in this mode will identify the appropriate TSIG key (or internally record
/// an error if it doesn't find a key).  The server will then verify the
/// query with the context, and generate a signed response using the same
/// same context.
///
/// When multiple messages belong to the same TSIG session, either side
/// (signer or verifier) will keep using the same context.  It records
/// the latest session state (such as the previous digest) so that repeated
/// calls to \c sign() or \c verify() work correctly in terms of the TSIG
/// protocol.
///
/// \b Examples
///
/// This is a typical client application that sends a TSIG signed query
/// and verifies the response.
///
/// \code
///    // "renderer" is of MessageRenderer to render the message.
///    // (TSIGKey would be configured from config or command line in real app)
///    TSIGContext ctx(TSIGKey("key.example:MSG6Ng=="));
///    Message message(Message::RENDER);
///    message.addQuestion(Question(Name("www.example.com"), RRClass::IN(),
///                                 RRType::A()));
///    message.toWire(renderer, ctx);
///
///    // sendto, then recvfrom.  received result in (data, data_len)
///
///    message.clear(Message::PARSE);
///    InputBuffer buffer(data, data_len);
///    message.fromWire(buffer);
///    TSIGError tsig_error = ctx.verify(message.getTSIGRecord(),
///                                      data, data_len);
///    if (tsig_error == TSIGError::NOERROR()) {
///        // okay.  ctx can be continuously used if it's receiving subsequent
///        // signed responses from a TCP stream.
///    } else if (message.getRcode() == Rcode::NOTAUTH()) {
///        // hard error.  give up this transaction per RFC2845 4.6.
///    } else {
///        // Other error: discard response keep waiting with the same ctx
///        // for another (again, RFC2845 4.6).
///    } \endcode
///
/// And this is a typical server application that authenticates a signed
/// query and returns a response according to the result.
///
/// \code
///    // Assume "message" is of type Message for query handling and
///    // "renderer" is of MessageRenderer to render responses.
///    Message message(Message::RENDER);
///
///    TSIGKeyRing keyring; // this must be configured with keys somewhere
///
///    // Receive a query and store it in (data, data_len)
///    InputBuffer buffer(data, data_len);
///    message.clear(Message::PARSE);
///    message.fromWire(buffer);
///
///    const TSIGRecord* tsig = message.getTSIGRecord();
///    if (tsig != NULL) {
///        TSIGContext ctx(tsig->getName(), tsig->getRdata().getAlgorithm(),
///                        keyring);
///        ctx.verify(tsig, data, data_len);
///
///        // prepare response
///        message.makeResponse();
///        //...
///        message.toWire(renderer, ctx);
///
///        // send the response data back to the client.
///        // If this is a beginning of a signed session over a TCP and
///        // server has more data to send to the client, this ctx
///        // will be used to sign subsequent messages.
///    } \endcode
///
/// <b>TCP Consideration</b>
///
/// RFC2845 describes the case where a single TSIG session is used for
/// multiple DNS messages (Section 4.4).  This class supports signing and
/// verifying the messages in this scenario, but does not care if the messages
/// were delivered over a TCP connection or not.  If, for example, the
/// same \c TSIGContext object is used to sign two independent DNS queries
/// sent over UDP, they will be considered to belong to the same TSIG
/// session, and, as a result, verification will be likely to fail.
///
/// \b Copyability
///
/// This class is currently non copyable based on the observation of the
/// typical usage as described above.  But there is no strong technical
/// reason why this class cannot be copyable.  If we see the need for it
/// in future we may change the implementation on this point.
///
/// <b>Note to developers:</b>
/// One basic design choice is to make the \c TSIGContext class is as
/// independent from the \c Message class.  This is because the latter is
/// much more complicated, depending on many other classes, while TSIG is
/// a very specific part of the entire DNS protocol set.  If the \c TSIGContext
/// class depends on \c \c Message, it will be more vulnerable to changes
/// to other classes, and will be more difficult to test due to the
/// direct or indirect dependencies.  The interface of \c sign() that takes
/// opaque data (instead of, e.g., a \c Message or \c MessageRenderer object)
/// is therefore a deliberate design decision.

/// \brief Tokenization state for \c MasterLexer.
///
/// This is a base class of classes that represent various states of a single
/// tokenization session of \c MasterLexer, i.e., the states used for a
/// single call to \c MasterLexer::getNextToken().
///
/// It follows the convention of the state design pattern: each derived class
/// corresponds to a specific state, and the state transition takes place
/// through the virtual method named \c handle().  The \c handle() method
/// takes the main \c MasterLexer object that holds all necessary internal
/// context, and updates it as necessary; each \c State derived class is
/// completely stateless.
///
/// The initial transition takes place in a static method of the base class,
/// \c start().  This is mainly for implementation convenience; we need to
/// pass options given to \c MasterLexer::getNextToken() for the initial
/// state, so it makes more sense to separate the interface for the transition
/// from the initial state.
///
/// If the whole lexer transition is completed within start(), it sets the
/// identified token and returns NULL; otherwise it returns a pointer to
/// an object of a specific state class that completes the session
/// on the call of handle().
///
/// As is usual in the state design pattern, the \c State class is made
/// a friend class of \c MasterLexer and can refer to its internal details.
/// This is intentional; essentially its a part of \c MasterLexer and
/// is defined as a separate class only for implementation clarity and better
/// testability.  It's defined in a publicly visible header, but that's only
/// for testing purposes.  No normal application or even no other classes of
/// this library are expected to use this class.

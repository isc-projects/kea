#   This file contains an example nginx HTTP server configuration which
#   enables reverse proxy service for Kea RESTful API. An access to
#   the service is protected by client's certificate verification
#   mechanism. Before using this configuration a server administrator
#   must generate server certificate and private key as well as
#   the certificate authority (CA). The clients' certificates must
#   be signed by the CA.
#
#   Note that the steps provided below to generate and setup certificates
#   are provided as an example for testing purposes only. Always
#   consider best known security measures to protect your production
#   environment.
#
#   The server certificate and key can be generated as follows:
#
#   openssl genrsa -des3 -out kea-proxy.key 4096
#   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key kea-proxy.key -out kea-proxy.crt
#
#   The CA certificate and key can be generated as follows:
#
#   openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
#   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
#
#
#   The client certificate needs to be generated and signed:
#
#   openssl genrsa -des3 -out kea-client.key 4096
#   openssl req -new -key kea-client.key -out kea-client.csr
#   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in kea-client.csr -CA ca.crt \
#           -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 10 -out kea-client.crt
#
#   Note that the 'common name' value used when generating the client
#   and the server certificates must differ from the value used
#   for the CA certificate.
#
#   The client certificate must be deployed on the client system.
#   In order to test the proxy configuration with 'curl' run
#   command similar to the following:
#
#   curl -k --key kea-client.key --cert kea-client.crt -X POST \
#        -H Content-Type:application/json -d '{ "command": "list-commands" }' \
#         https://kea.example.org
#
#   On some curl running on macOS the crypto library requires a PKCS#12
#   bundle with the private key and the certificate as the cert argument.
#   The PKCS#12 file can be generated by:
#
#   openssl pkcs12 -export -in kea-client.crt -inkey kea-client.key \
#           -out kea-client.p12
#
#   If the password is 1234, curl command becomes:
#
#   curl -k --cert kea-client.p12:1234 -X POST \
#        -H Content-Type:application/json -d '{ "command": "list-commands" }' \
#         https://kea.example.org
#
#   nginx configuration starts here.

@file Dabase Utilities

This file holds the "dbutil" program, a general utility program for doing
management of the BIND 10 database.  There are two modes of operation:

      b10-dbutil --check [--verbose] database
      b10-dbutil --upgrade [--noconfirm] [--verbose] database

The first form checks the version of the given database.  The second form
upgrades the database to the latest version of the schema, omitting the
warning prompt if --noconfirm is given.

For maximum safety, prior to the upgrade a backup database is created.
The is the database name with ".backup" appended to it (or ".backup-n" if
".backup" already exists).  This is used to restore the database if the
upgrade fails.

# @brief Statements to Update the Database
# These are in the form of a list of dictionaries, each of which contains the
# information to perform an incremental upgrade from one version of the
# database to the next.  The information is:
#
# a) from: (major, minor) version that the database is expected to be at
#    to perform this upgrade.
# b) to: (major, minor) version of the database to which this set of statements
#    upgrades the database to.  (This is used for documentation purposes,
#    and to update the schema_version table when the upgrade is complete.)
# c) statements: List of SQL statments to perform the upgrade.
#
# The incremental upgrades are performed one after the other.  If the version
# of the database does not exactly match that required for the incremental
# upgrade, the upgrade is skipped.  For this reason, the list must be in
# ascending order (e.g. upgrade 1.0 to 2.0, 2.0 to 2.1, 2.1 to 2.2 etc.).
#
# Note that apart from the 1.0 to 2.0 upgrade, no upgrade need alter the
# schema_version table: that is done by the upgrade process using the
# information in the "to" field.

Support optional origin in $INCLUDE:
$INCLUDE filename origin

Support optional comment in $INCLUDE:
$INCLUDE filename origin comment

Support optional comment in $TTL (RFC 2308):
$TTL number comment

If ttl is not set on the record line but $TTL is set at top,
it is not loaded. But running master.py manually does show the
TTL to be same as the $TTL. When including the ttl on every line,
it is loaded and can be served.

Open questions to document in manual page:

What happens in the database? replaces existing? What if a.foo
existed but new zone file didn't have a.foo, would previous a.foo
in database be removed?

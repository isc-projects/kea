/// \brief A testcase part for faking the SocketRequestor in tests
///
/// It's awkward to request real sockets from the real socket creator
/// during tests (for one, because it would have to be running, for
/// another, we need to block real ports).  If you instantiate this class in
/// a test case, the socket requestor will be initialized to a test one which
/// handles fake socket FDs and stores what was requested, etc.
///
/// Furthermore, you can check if the code requested or released the correct
/// list of sockets using the checkTokens() method.
///
/// Some member variables are intentionally made public so that test cases
/// can easily check the value of them.  We prefer convenience for tests over
/// class integrity here.

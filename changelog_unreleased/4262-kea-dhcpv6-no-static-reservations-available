[bug]		tmark
	Fixed an issue in kea-dhcp6 that caused the server to
	not use a reserved host name or recognize a change to
	the selected subnet for subnet-level reservations
	within a shared-network when a lease exists for the
	reservation but is in either the RELEASED or
	EXPIRED-RECLAIMED states.

// each physical link there is one IPv4 subnet that the server is expected
// to manage. However, in some cases there is a need to configure more subnets
// in the same physical location. The most common use case is an existing
// subnet that grew past its original assumptions and ran out of addresses,
// so the sysadmin needs to add another subnet on top of existing one.

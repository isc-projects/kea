-- This is the Kea DHCP schema specification for PostgreSQL.

-- The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of some field types
-- specification, which are PostgreSQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed
-- for other databases.

-- To create the schema, either type the command:

-- psql -U <user> -W <password> <database> < dhcpdb_create.pgsql

-- ... at the command prompt, or log in to the PostgreSQL database and at the "postgres=#"
-- prompt, issue the command:

-- @dhcpdb_create.pgsql

-- Finally, the version of the schema.  We start at 0.1 during development.

-- first column is called "version" and not "major".

-- NOTE: this MUST be kept in step with src/lib/dhcpsrv/tests/schema_copy.h,
--       which defines the schema for the unit tests.  If you are updating
--       the version number, the schema has changed: please ensure that
--       schema_copy.h has been updated as well.

-- Notes:

-- Indexes
-- =======
-- It is likely that additional indexes will be needed.  However, the
-- increase in lookup performance from these will come at the expense
-- of a decrease in performance during insert operations due to the need
-- to update the indexes.  For this reason, the need for additional indexes
-- will be determined by experiment during performance tests.

-- The most likely additional indexes will cover the following columns:

-- hwaddr and client_id
-- For lease stability: if a client requests a new lease, try to find an
-- existing or recently expired lease for it so that it can keep using the
-- same IP address.

-- Field Sizes
-- ===========
-- If any of the VARxxx field sizes are altered, the lengths in the PgSQL
-- backend source file (pgsql_lease_mgr.cc) must be correspondingly changed.

-- Portability
-- ===========
-- Some columns contain binary data so are stored as BYTEA instead of
-- VARCHAR.  This may be non-portable between databases: in this case, the
-- definition should be changed to VARCHAR.

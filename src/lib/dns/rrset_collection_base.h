/// necessarily form a valid zone (e.g. there doesn't necessarily have
/// to be an SOA at the "origin"). Instead, it will be used to represent
/// a single zone for the purpose of zone loading/checking. It provides
/// a simple find() method to find an RRset for the given name and type
/// (and maybe class) and a way to iterate over all RRsets.
///
/// See \c RRsetCollection for a simple libdns++ implementation using an
/// STL container. libdatasrc will have another implementation.

    /// Returns the RRset in the collection that exactly matches the
    /// given \c name, \c rrclass and \c rrtype.  If no matching RRset
    /// is found, \c NULL is returned.
    ///
    /// This method's implementations currently are not specified to
    /// handle \c RRTypes such as RRSIG and NSEC3.  This interface may be
    /// refined to clarify this point in the future, and perhaps, provide
    /// additional API for these RRType.
    ///
    /// As for RRSIG, there are some fundamental open questions.  For
    /// example, it's not clear whether we want to return all RRSIGs of
    /// the given name covering any RR types (in which case, we need to
    /// figure out how), or we need to extend the interface so we can
    /// specify the covered type.  A specific derived implementation may
    /// return something if type RRSIG is specified, but this is not
    /// specified here at the base class level. So, for RRSIGs the
    /// behavior should be assumed as undefined.
    ///
    /// As for NSEC3, it's not clear whether owner names (which included
    /// hashed labels) are the best choice of search key, because in many
    /// cases, what the application wants to find is an NSEC3 that has the
    /// hash of some particular "normal" domain names.  Also, if the underlying
    /// implementation encapsulates a single zone, NSEC3 records conceptually
    /// belong to a separate name space, which may cause implementation
    /// difficulty.
    ///
    /// Behavior with meta types such as ANY and AXFR are also
    /// undefined. A specific implementation may return something for
    /// these.  But, unlike the case of RRSIGs, these types of RRsets
    /// are not expected to be added to any implementation of
    /// collection in the first place (by the definition of "meta
    /// types"), so querying for such types is basically an invalid
    /// operation. The API doesn't require implementations to check
    /// this condition and reject it, so the behavior is
    /// undefined. This interface will not be refined in future

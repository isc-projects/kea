Feature: control with bindctl
    Assorted tests using bindctl for the administration of BIND 10.


    Scenario: Removing modules
        # This test runs the original example configuration, which has
        # a number of modules. It then removes all non-essential modules,
        # and checks whether they do disappear from the list of running
        # modules (note that it 'misuses' the help command for this,
        # there is a Init command 'show_processes' but it's output is
        # currently less standardized than 'help')
        Given I have bind10 running with configuration bindctl_commands.config
        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
        And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message ZONEMGR_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED

        And wait for bind10 stderr message XFROUT_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message STATS_STARTING
        And wait for bind10 stderr message STATSHTTPD_STARTED

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components/NOSUCHMODULE
        last bindctl output should contain Error

        bind10 module Xfrout should be running
        bind10 module Stats should be running
        bind10 module Zonemgr should be running
        bind10 module Xfrin should be running
        bind10 module Auth should be running
        bind10 module StatsHttpd should be running
        bind10 module Resolver should not be running

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-xfrout
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED
        last bindctl output should not contain Error

        # assuming it won't error for further modules (if it does, the final
        # 'should not be running' tests would fail anyway)
        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-stats-httpd
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED
        last bindctl output should not contain Error

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-stats
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-zonemgr
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED
        last bindctl output should not contain Error

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-xfrin
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED
        last bindctl output should not contain Error

        Then remove bind10 configuration Init/components value b10-auth
        And wait for new bind10 stderr message BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED
        last bindctl output should not contain Error

        # After these ^^^ have been stopped...

        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC

        # This would fail if the entire list was passed, or the configuration

        send bind10 the command config show Init/components

    Scenario: Shutting down a certain module
        # We could test with several modules, but for now we are particularly
        # interested in shutting down cmdctl.  It previously caused hangup,
        # so this scenario confirms it's certainly fixed.  Note: since cmdctl
        # is a "needed" component, shutting it down will result in system
        # shutdown.  So "send bind10 command" will fail (it cannot complete
        # "quite").
        Given I have bind10 running with configuration bindctl/bindctl.config
        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC

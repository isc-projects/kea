% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_COMMIT committing to PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a commit call.  All outstanding transactions will be
committed to the database.  Note that depending on the PostgreSQL settings,
the committal may not include a write to disk.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_DB_RECONNECT_ATTEMPT_FAILED database reconnect failed: %1
An error message issued when an attempt to reconnect has failed.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_DB_RECONNECT_ATTEMPT_SCHEDULE scheduling attempt %1 of %2 in %3 milliseconds
An info message issued when the server is scheduling the next attempt to reconnect
to the database.  This occurs when the server has lost database connectivity and
is attempting to reconnect automatically.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_DB_RECONNECT_FAILED maximum number of database reconnect attempts: %1, has been exhausted without success
An error message issued when the server failed to reconnect.  Loss of connectivity
is typically a network or database server issue.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_DEALLOC_ERROR An error occurred deallocating SQL statements while closing the PostgreSQL log database: %1
This is an error message issued when a legal log hook library experienced
and error freeing database SQL resources as part of closing its connection to
the PostgreSQL database.  The connection is closed as part of normal server
shutdown.  This error is most likely a programmatic issue that is highly
unlikely to occur or negatively impact server operation.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_FATAL_ERROR Unrecoverable PostgreSQL error occurred: Statement: <%1>, reason: %2 (error code: %3).
An error message indicating that communication with the PostgreSQL database server
has been lost.  When this occurs the server exits immediately with a non-zero
exit code.  This is most likely due to a network issue.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_GET_VERSION obtaining schema version information
Logged at debug log level 50.
A debug message issued when the server is about to obtain schema version
information from the PostgreSQL database.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_INSERT_LOG Adding a log entry to the database: %1
Logged at debug log level 50.
An informational message logged when a log entry is inserted.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_INVALID_ACCESS invalid database access string: %1
This is logged when an attempt has been made to parse a database access string
and the attempt ended in error.  The access string in question - which
should be of the form 'keyword=value keyword=value...' is included in
the message.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_NO_TLS_SUPPORT Attempt to configure TLS (unsupported for PostgreSQL): %1
This error message is printed when TLS support was required in the Kea
configuration: Kea was built with this feature disabled for PostgreSQL.
The parameters of the connection are logged.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_ROLLBACK rolling back PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a rollback call.  All outstanding transaction will
be rolled back and not committed to the database.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_START_TRANSACTION starting a new PostgreSQL transaction
A debug message issued when a new PostgreSQL transaction is being started.
This message is typically not issued when inserting data into a
single table because the server doesn't explicitly start
transactions in this case. This message is issued when data is
inserted into multiple tables with multiple INSERT statements
and there may be a need to rollback the whole transaction if
any of these INSERT statements fail.

% LEGAL_LOG_PGSQL_TLS_SUPPORT Attempt to configure TLS: %1
This informational message is printed when TLS support was required in
the Kea configuration: The TLS support in PostgreSQL will be initialized but
its configuration is fully managed outside the C API.
The parameters of the connection are logged.

% PGSQL_FB_DB opening PostgreSQL log database: %1
This informational message is logged when a legal log hook library is
about to open a PostgreSQL log database.  The parameters of the
connection including database name and username needed to access it
(but not the password if any) are logged.

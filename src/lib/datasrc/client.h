/// \brief The base class of data source clients.
///
/// This is an abstract base class that defines the common interface for
/// various types of data source clients.  A data source client is a top level
/// access point to a data source, allowing various operations on the data
/// source such as lookups, traversing or updates.  The client class itself
/// has limited focus and delegates the responsibility for these specific
/// operations to other classes; in general methods of this class act as
/// factories of these other classes.
///
/// The following derived classes are currently (expected to be) provided:
/// - \c InMemoryClient: A client of a conceptual data source that stores
/// all necessary data in memory for faster lookups
/// - \c DatabaseClient: A client that uses a real database backend (such as
/// an SQL database).  It would internally hold a connection to the underlying
/// database system.
///
/// \note It is intentional that while the term these derived classes don't
/// contain "DataSource" unlike their base class.  It's also noteworthy
/// that the naming of the base class is somewhat redundant because the
/// namespace \c datasrc would indicate that it's related to a data source.
/// The redundant naming comes from the observation that namespaces are
/// often omitted with \c using directives, in which case "Client"
/// would be too generic.  On the other hand, concrete derived classes are
/// generally not expected to be referenced directly from other modules and
/// applications, so we'll give them more concise names such as InMemoryClient.
///
/// A single \c DataSourceClient object is expected to handle only a single
/// RR class even if the underlying data source contains records for multiple
/// RR classes.  Likewise, (when we support views) a \c DataSourceClient
/// object is expected to handle only a single view.
///
/// If the application uses multiple threads, each thread will need to
/// create and use a separate DataSourceClient.  This is because some
/// database backend doesn't allow multiple threads to share the same
/// connection to the database.
///
/// \note For a client using an in memory backend, this may result in
/// having a multiple copies of the same data in memory, increasing the
/// memory footprint substantially.  Depending on how to support multiple
/// CPU cores for concurrent lookups on the same single data source (which
/// is not fully fixed yet, and for which multiple threads may be used),
/// this design may have to be revisited.
///
/// This class (and therefore its derived classes) are not copyable.
/// This is because the derived classes would generally contain attributes
/// that are not easy to copy (such as a large size of in memory data or a
/// network connection to a database server).  In order to avoid a surprising
/// disruption with a naive copy it's prohibited explicitly.  For the expected
/// usage of the client classes the restriction should be acceptable.
///
/// \todo This class is not complete. It needs more factory methods, for
///     accessing the whole zone, updating it, loading it, etc.

///
/// This class is an entry point to the use of HTTP services in Kea.
/// It creates a transport acceptor service on the specified address and
/// port and listens to the incoming HTTP connections. The constructor
/// receives a pointer to the implementation of the
/// @ref HttpResponseCreatorFactory, which is used by the @ref HttpListener
/// to create/retrieve an instance of the @ref HttpResponseCreator when the
/// new HTTP response needs to be generated. The @ref HttpResponseCreator
/// creates an object derived from the @ref HttpResponse class, encapsulating
/// a HTTP response following some specific rules, e.g. having
/// "application/json" content type.
///
/// When the listener is started it creates an instance of a @ref HttpConnection
/// and stores them in the pool of active connections. The @ref HttpConnection
/// is responsible for managing the next connection received and receiving the
/// HTTP request and sending appropriate response. The listener can handle
/// many HTTP connections simultaneously.
///
/// When the @ref HttpListener::stop is invoked, all active connections are
/// closed and the listener stops accepting new connections.

/// \brief The log message formatter
///
/// This class allows us to format logging messages conveniently. We
/// call something like logger.warn(WARN_MSG).arg(15).arg(dnsMsg). This
/// outputs some text with placeholders replaced by the arguments, if
/// the logging verbosity is at WARN level or more.
///
/// To make this work, we use the Formatter. The warn (or whatever logging
/// function) returns a Formatter object. That one holds the string to be
/// output with the placeholders. It also remembers if there should be any
/// output at all (eg. if the logging is enabled for this level). When there's
/// no .arg call on the object, it is destroyed right away and we use the
/// destructor to output the text (but only in case we should output anything).
///
/// If there's an .arg call, we return reference to the same object, so another
/// .arg can be called on it. After the last .arg call is done, the object is
/// destroyed and, again, we can produce the output.
///
/// Of course, if the logging is turned off, we don't bother with any replacing
/// and just return.
///
/// User of logging code should not really care much about this class, only
/// call the .arg method to generate the correct output.
///
/// The class is a template to allow easy testing. Also, we want everything
/// here in the header anyway and it doesn't depend on the details of what
/// Logger really is, so it doesn't hurt anything.
///
/// Also, if you are interested in the internals, you might find the copy
/// constructor a bit strange. It deactivates the original formatter. We don't
/// really want to support copying of the Formatter by user, but C++ needs a
/// copy constructor when returning from the logging functions, so we need one.
/// And if we did not deactivate the original Formatter, that one would get
/// destroyed before any call to .arg, producing an output, and then the one
/// the .arg calls are called on would get destroyed as well, producing output
/// again. So, think of this behaviour as soul moving from one to another.

/// A low-level, RR type-independent representation of DNS RDATA.
///
/// <b>Purpose of the Class</b>
///
/// This class intends to help "serialization" of the content of RDATA
/// in a space-efficient manner.  Specific derived classes of \c Rdata
/// focus on the convenience of accessing RDATA fields for RR type-specific
/// protocol operations, and can be inefficient in terms of space.
/// For example, a DNS character string may be internally represented as a
/// \c std::string object with all of the overhead of the richer class.
/// If an application needs to maintain a very large number of RRs and it
/// does not have to perform RR specific operation so often, it may make more
/// sense to store the data in memory in a lower-level but space efficient
/// form.
///
/// Another purpose of this class is to improve rendering performance for
/// RDATA.  If the only requirement were space efficiency, it would be just
/// sufficient to convert the \c RDATA into a binary sequence in the wire
/// format.  However, to render the data in a DNS message, we'd have to
/// re-construct a corresponding \c Rdata object in the case where name
/// compression is necessary.  This is not desirable, and this class is
/// provided to avoid such unnecessary overhead.
///
/// <b>Data Format</b>
///
/// To meet these goals, this class helps convert an \c Rdata object into
/// two pieces of information: Wire-format representation of the \c Rdata
/// and associated meta information for efficient rendering.
///
/// Specifically, it maintains the wire-format data as a sequence of typed
/// fields.  The types are:
/// - Compressible name: a domain name as an RDATA field that can be compressed
/// - Incompressible name: a domain name as an RDATA field that cannot be
///   compressed
/// - Other data: any other fields of RDATA, which should be treated as opaque
///
/// (See also the description of \c RdataFields::Type)
/// Whether a name can or cannot be compressed is determined according to
/// RFC3597.
///
/// A "other data" field may not always correspond to a single RDATA field.
/// A \c RdataFields field (of other data) is just a contiguous region of the
/// wire-format data that does not involve name compression.
/// For example, the SOA RDATA begins with two "compressible" names followed
/// by 5 32-bit fields.
/// In \c RdataFields the last 5 fields would be considered a single 20-byte
/// field.
///
/// Each \c RdataFields field is identified by the \c FieldSpec structure,
/// which provides the type and length of the field.
/// An \c RdataFields object internally maintains a sequence of \c FieldSpec
/// objects in a form of plain C-style array, which can be referenced via
/// a pointer returned by the \c getFieldSpecData() method.
/// The \c \c FieldSpec for a specific field can also be retrieved by the
/// \c getFieldSpec() method.
///
/// The following diagram shows the internal memory representation of
/// an SOA RDATA in the form of \c RdataFields object and how an application
/// can get access to the memory region.

/// where MNAME and RNAME are wire format representations of the MNAME and
/// RNAME fields of the SOA RDATA, respectively, and "Rest of the data"
/// encodes the remaining 20 bytes of the RDATA in network byte order.
///
/// <b>Usage of the Class</b>
///
/// One major and common use case of the \c RdataFields class is to convert
/// a \c Rdata object (possibly given from a DNS message or some configuration
/// source such as a zone file) in the serialized format and store a copy of
/// the data somewhere in memory.  The following code sample implements this
/// scenario:
/// \code // assume "rdata" is a reference type to \c Rdata
/// const RdataFields fields(rdata);
/// const unsigned int nfields = fields.getFieldCount();
/// memcpy(some_place, fields.getFieldSpecData(), nfields*sizeof(FieldSpec));
/// const size_t data_length = fields.getDataLength();
/// memcpy(other_place, fields.getData(), data_length);
/// // (nfields and data_length should be stored somewhere, too)
/// \endcode
///
/// Another typical usage is to render the stored data in the wire format
/// as efficiently as possible.  The following code is an example of such
/// usage:
/// \code // assume "renderer" is of type MessageRenderer
/// // retrieve data_length and nfields from the storage
/// RdataFields(static_cast<const FieldSpec*>(some_place),
///             nfields, other_place, data_length).toWire(renderer);
/// \endcode
///
/// <b>Notes to Users</b>
///
/// The main purposes of this class is to help efficient operation
/// for some (limited classes of) performance sensitive application.
/// For this reason the interface and implementation rely on relatively
/// lower-level, riskier primitives such as passing around bear pointers.
///
/// It is therefore discouraged to use this class for general purpose
/// applications that do not need to maximize performance in terms of either
/// memory footprint or rendering speed.
/// All functionality provided by this class can be achieved via higher level
/// interfaces such as the \c Rdata class variants.
/// Normal applications should use those interfaces.
///
/// The data format is public information so that an application can examine
/// and use selected parts of data.  For example, an application may want to
/// encode domain names in RDATA in a different way while storing the other
/// data in a separate place.
/// However, at this moment the format is still in flux, and it may not
/// be compatible with future versions (see below).
///
/// <b>Development Notes</b>
///
/// We should conduct benchmark tests to measure rendering performance.
///
/// The current implementation needs to re-construct name objects from
/// compressible and incompressible name fields as wire-format data.
/// This is not efficient, and we'll probably want to improve this in a
/// future version.  One possibility is to store offset information as well
/// as the name data (at the cost of increasing memory footprint), and
/// to use the pair of data for faster rendering.

    /// to construct a \c Name object for each domain name field of an RDATA
    /// and use it for some special purpose.
    /// The \c FieldSpec structure provides necessary parameters to get access
    /// to a specific \c RdataFields field.
    ///
    /// The following code snippet implements the above example scenario:
    /// \code // assume "fields" is of type RdataFields
    /// size_t offset = 0;
    /// for (int i = 0; i < fields.getFieldCount(); ++i) {
    ///     const FieldSpec spec = fields.getFieldSpec(i);
    ///     if (spec.type == RdataFields::COMPRESSIBLE_NAME ||
    ///         spec.type == RdataFields::INCOMPRESSIBLE_NAME) {
    ///         InputBuffer ibuffer(fields.getData() + offset, spec.len);
    ///         Name name(ibuffer);
    ///         // do something with name
    ///     }
    ///     offset += spec.len;
    /// } \endcode
    ///
    /// Note that the offset is not included in \c FieldSpec.
    /// This is because such deeper inspection would be a relatively rare
    /// operation while it is desirable to keep this structure as small as
    /// possible for the purpose of space efficiency.
    /// Also, if and when an application wants to look into a specific field,
    /// it would be quite likely that the application iterates over all fields
    /// and does something special for selected fields like the above example.
    /// In that case the application can easily and efficiently identify the

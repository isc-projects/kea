/// @brief Concrete implementation of a lease database backend using flat file.
///
/// This class implements a lease database backend using CSV files to store
/// DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 leases on disk. The format of the files is determined
/// by the @c CSVLeaseFile4 and @c CSVLeaseFile6 classes.
///
/// The backend stores leases incrementally, i.e. updates to leases are appended
/// at the end of the lease file. To record the deletion of a lease, the lease
/// record is appended to the lease file with the valid lifetime set to 0.
///
/// When the backend is starting up, it reads leases from the lease file (one
/// by one) and adds them to the in-memory container as follows:
/// - if the lease record being parsed identifies a lease which is not present
/// in the container, and the lease has valid lifetime greater than 0,
/// the lease is added to the container,
/// - if the lease record being parsed identifies a lease which is present in
/// the container, and the valid lifetime of the lease record being parsed is
/// greater than 0, the lease in the container is updated
/// - if the lease record being parsed has valid lifetime equal to 0, and the
/// corresponding lease exists in the container, the lease is removed from
/// the container.
///
/// After the container holding leases is initialized, each subsequent update,
/// removal or addition of the lease is appended to the lease file
/// synchronously.
///
/// Originally, the Memfile backend didn't write leases to disk. This was
/// particularly useful for testing server performance in non-disk bound
/// conditions. In order to preserve this capability, the new parameter
/// "persist=true|false" has been introduced in the database access string.
/// For example, database access string: "type=memfile persist=true"
/// enables writes of leases to a disk.
///
/// The lease file locations can be specified with the "name=[path]"
/// parameter in the database access string. The [path] is the
/// absolute path to the file (including file name). If this parameter
/// is not specified, the default location in the installation
/// directory is used: var/kea/kea-leases4.csv and
/// var/kea/kea-leases6.csv.

@mainpage Kea Ping Check Hooks Library

Welcome to Kea Ping Check Hooks Library. This documentation is
addressed at developers who are interested in internal operation of the
library. This file provides information needed to understand and perhaps
extend this library.

This documentation is stand-alone: you should have read and
understood <a href="https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/">Kea
Developer's Guide</a> and in particular its section about hooks: <a
href="https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/df/d46/hooksdgDevelopersGuide.html">
Hooks Developer's Guide</a>.

@section cbPingCheckOverview Overview
The @c ping_check hooks library provides the ability for kea-dhcp4 to carry
out an ICMP ECHO test of a candidate IP address prior to sending that address to
a DHCPv4 client in a DHCPOFFER message.

@section cbPingCheckInternals Library Internals

In addition to the requisite @ref load() and @ref unload() functions, the library
implements the following callouts:

- @ref dhcp4_srv_configured() - schedules a (re)start of the ICMP IO layer
- @ref lease4_offer() - handles requests from kea-dhcp4 core to initiate a ping check
for a candidate lease

The load() function instantiates an instance of @ref isc::ping_check::PingCheckMgr.
This class is the top level object that provides configuration processing and supervises
the execution of ping checks.

@section cbPingCheckMTCompatibility Multi-Threading Compatibility

The @c ping_check hooks library requires multi-threading.

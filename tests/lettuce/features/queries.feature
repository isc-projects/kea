Feature: Querying feature
    This feature is a collection of non-specific querying tests;
    for instance whether multiple queries in a row return consistent
    answers.

    Scenario: Repeated queries
        Given I have bind10 running with configuration example.org.inmem.config
        And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
        And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
        And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED

        bind10 module Auth should be running
        And bind10 module Resolver should not be running
	And bind10 module Xfrout should not be running
	And bind10 module Zonemgr should not be running
	And bind10 module Xfrin should not be running
	And bind10 module Stats should not be running

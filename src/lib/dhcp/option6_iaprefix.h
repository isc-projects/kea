/// @brief Class that represents IAPREFIX option in DHCPv6
///
/// It is based on a similar class that handles addresses. There are major
/// differences, though. The fields are in different order. There is also
/// additional prefix length field.
///
/// It should be noted that to get a full prefix (2 values: base prefix, and
/// a prefix length) 2 methods are used: getAddress() and getLength(). Although
/// using getAddress() to obtain base prefix is somewhat counter-intuitive at
/// first, it becomes obvious when one realizes that an address is a special
/// case of a prefix with /128. It makes everyone's life much easier, because
/// the base prefix doubles as a regular address in many cases, e.g. when
/// searching for a lease.
///
/// When searching for a prefix in the database or simply comparing two prefixes
/// for equality, it is important that only the significant parts of the
/// prefixes are compared. It is possible that the client or a server sends a
/// prefix which has non-significant bits (beyond prefix length) set. The
/// server or client receiving such a prefix should be liberal and not discard
/// this prefix. It should rather ignore the non-significant bits. Therefore
/// the unpack() function, which parses the prefix from the wire, always sets
/// the non-significant bits to 0 so as two prefixes received on the wire can
/// be compared without additional processing.
///
/// @todo Currently, the constructor which creates the option from the textual
/// format doesn't set non-significant bits to 0. This is because it is assumed
/// that the prefixes from the string are created locally (not received over the
/// wire) and should be validated before the option is created. If we wanted
/// to set non-significant bits to 0 when the prefix is created from the textual
/// format it would have some peformance implications, because the option would
/// need to be turned into wire format, appropriate bits set to 0 and then
/// option would need to be created again from the wire format. We may consider
/// doing it if we find a use case where it is required.

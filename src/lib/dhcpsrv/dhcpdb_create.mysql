# This is the BIND 10 DHCP schema specification for MySQL.
#
# The schema is reasonably portable (with the exception of the engine
# specification, which is MySQL-specific).  Minor changes might be needed for
# other databases.

# To create the schema, either type the command:
#
# mysql -u <user> -p <password> <database> < dhcpdb_create.mysql
#
# ... at the command prompt, or log in to the MySQL database and at the "mysql>"
# prompt, issue the command:
#
# source dhcpdb_create.mysql

# Finally, the version of the schema.  We start at 0.1 during development.
# This table is only modified during schema upgrades.  For historical reasons
# (related to the names of the columns in the BIND 10 DNS database file), the
# first column is called "version" and not "major".
#
# NOTE: this MUST be kept in step with src/lib/dhcpsrv/tests/schema_copy.h,
#       which defines the schema for the unit tests.  If you are updating
#       the version number, the schema has changed: please ensure that
#       schema_copy.h has been updated as well.

# Notes:
#
# Indexes
# =======
# It is likely that additional indexes will be needed.  However, the
# increase in lookup performance from these will come at the expense
# of a decrease in performance during insert operations due to the need
# to update the indexes.  For this reason, the need for additional indexes
# will be determined by experiment during performance tests.
#
# The most likely additional indexes will cover the following columns:
#
# expire
# To speed up the deletion of expired leases from the database.
#
# hwaddr and client_id
# For lease stability: if a client requests a new lease, try to find an
# existing or recently expired lease for it so that it can keep using the
# same IP address.
#
# Field Sizes
# ===========
# If any of the VARxxx field sizes are altered, the lengths in the MySQL
# backend source file (mysql_lease_mgr.cc) must be correspondingly changed.
#
# Portability
# ===========
# The "ENGINE = INNODB" on some tables is not portablea to another database
# and will need to be removed.
#
# Some columns contain binary data so are stored as VARBINARY instead of
# VARCHAR.  This may be non-portable between databases: in this case, the
# definition should be changed to VARCHAR.

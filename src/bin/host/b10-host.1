.SH "NAME"
b10-host \- DNS lookup utility
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBb10\-host\fR\ 'u
\fBb10\-host\fR [\fB\-a\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fR\fB\fIclass\fR\fR] [\fB\-d\fR] [\fB\-p\ \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR] [\fB\-r\fR] [\fB\-t\ \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR] [\fB\-v\fR] [\fIname\fR] [\fB\fIserver\fR\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-host\fR
utility does DNS lookups\&. Its initial goal is to be a
\fBhost\fR(1)
clone, but also add a few features useful for BIND 10 development testing\&.
.PP
By default, it looks up the A, AAAA, and MX record sets for the
\fIname\fR\&. Optionally, you may select a name server to query against by adding the
\fIserver\fR
argument\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-a\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose mode and do a query for type ANY\&. (If the
\fB\-t\fR
option is also set, then the ANY query is not done, but it still uses verbose mode\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c \fR\fB\fIclass\fR\fR
.RS 4
Define the class for the query\&. The default is IN (Internet)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose output mode, including elapsed time in milliseconds\&. Verbose mode shows the header, question, answer, authority, and additional sections (if provided)\&. (Same as
\fB\-v\fR\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p \fR\fB\fIport\fR\fR
.RS 4
Select an alternative port for the query\&. This may be a number or a service name\&. The default is 53 (domain)\&. This is not a standard feature of
\fBhost\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR
.RS 4
Disable recursive processing by not setting the Recursion Desired flag in the query\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-t \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR
.RS 4
Select a specific resource record type for the query\&. By default, it looks up the A, AAAA, and MX record sets\&.
(This overrides the
\fB\-a\fR
option\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR
.RS 4
Same as
\fB\-d\fR
option\&.
.RE
.SH "COMPATIBILITY / BUGS"
.PP

\fBb10\-host\fR
does not do reverse lookups by default yet (by detecting if name is a IPv4 or IPv6 address)\&.
.PP
Unknown
\fB\-c\fR
class or
\fB\-t\fR
type causes
\fBb10\-host\fR
to Abort\&.
.PP
Not all types are supported yet for formatting\&. Not all switches are supported yet\&.
.PP
It doesn\'t use
/etc/resolv\&.conf
at this time\&. The default name server used is 127\&.0\&.0\&.1\&.
.PP

\fBb10\-host\fR
does not do reverse lookups by default yet (by detecting if name is a IPv4 or IPv6 address)\&.
.PP

\fB\-p\fR
is not a standard feature\&.
.SH "HISTORY"
.PP
The C++ version of
\fBb10\-host\fR
was started in October 2009 by Jeremy C\&. Reed of ISC\&. Its usage and output were based on the standard
\fBhost\fR
command\&.

/**
 * \brief Loader of ACLs.
 *
 * The goal of this class is to convert JSON description of an ACL to object
 * of the ACL class (including the checks inside it).
 *
 * The class can be used to load the checks only. This is supposed to be used
 * by compound checks to create the subexpressions.
 *
 * To allow any kind of checks to exist in the application, creators are
 * registered for the names of the checks.
 *
 * An ACL definition looks like this:
 * \verbatim
 * [
 *   {
 *      "action": "ACCEPT",
 *      "match-type": <parameter>
 *   },
 *   {
 *      "action": "REJECT",
 *      "match-type": <parameter>
 *      "another-match-type": [<parameter1>, <parameter2>]
*    },
*    {
*       "action": "DROP"
*    }
 * ]
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * This is a list of elements. Each element must have an "action"
 * entry/keyword. That one specifies which action is returned if this
 * element matches (the value of the key is passed to the action loader
 * (see the constructor). It may be any piece of JSON which the action
 * loader expects.
 *
 * The rest of the element are matches. The left side is the name of the
 * match type (for example match for source IP address or match for message
 * size). The <parameter> is whatever is needed to describe the match and
 * depends on the match type, the loader passes it verbatim to creator
 * of that match type.
 *
 * There may be multiple match types in single element. In such case, all
 * of the matches must match for the element to take action (so, in the second
 * element, both "match-type" and "another-match-type" must be satisfied).
 * If there's no match in the element, the action is taken/returned without
 * conditions, every time (makes sense as the last entry, as the ACL will
 * never get past it).
 *
 * The second entry shows another thing - if there's a list as the value
 * for some match and the match itself is not expecting a list, it is taken
 * as an "or" - a match for at last one of the choices in the list must match.
 * So, for the second entry, both "match-type" and "another-match-type" must
 * be satisfied, but the another one is satisfied by either parameter1 or
 * parameter2.

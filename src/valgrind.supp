# Valgrind suppressions file. Place permanent suppressions that we never
# want to reconsider again into this file. For temporary suppressions
# that we want to revisit in the future, use
# valgrind-suppressions.revisit.
#
# Don't add any "obj:" lines in suppressions as these are likely
# site-specific. Use "..." instead to match these. Look at the other
# suppressions as examples.
#
# In case you want to make sense of the following symbols, demangle them
# with a command like: c++filt < valgrind-suppressions

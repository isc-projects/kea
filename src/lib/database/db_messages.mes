% DATABASE_CQL_CONNECTION_BEGIN_TRANSACTION begin transaction on current connection.
The server has issued a begin transaction call.

% DATABASE_CQL_CONNECTION_COMMIT committing to Cassandra database on current connection.
A commit call been issued on the server. For Cassandra, this is a no-op.

% DATABASE_CQL_CONNECTION_ROLLBACK rolling back Cassandra database on current connection.
The code has issued a rollback call. For Cassandra, this is a no-op.

% DATABASE_CQL_DEALLOC_ERROR An error occurred while closing the CQL connection: %1
This is an error message issued when a DHCP server (either V4 or V6) experienced
and error freeing CQL database resources as part of closing its connection to
the Cassandra database. The connection is closed as part of normal server
shutdown. This error is most likely a programmatic issue that is highly
unlikely to occur or negatively impact server operation.

% DATABASE_INVALID_ACCESS invalid database access string: %1
This is logged when an attempt has been made to parse a database access string
and the attempt ended in error.  The access string in question - which
should be of the form 'keyword=value keyword=value...' is included in
the message.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_COMMIT committing to MySQL database
The code has issued a commit call.  All outstanding transactions will be
committed to the database.  Note that depending on the MySQL settings,
the committal may not include a write to disk.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_FATAL_ERROR Unrecoverable MySQL error occurred: %1 for <%2>, reason: %3 (error code: %4).
An error message indicating that communication with the MySQL database server
has been lost.  If automatic recovery has been enabled,  then the server will
attempt to recover connectivity.  If not the server wil exit with a
non-zero exit code.  The cause of such an error is most likely a network issue
or the MySQL server has gone down.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_ROLLBACK rolling back MySQL database
The code has issued a rollback call.  All outstanding transaction will
be rolled back and not committed to the database.

% DATABASE_MYSQL_START_TRANSACTION starting new MySQL transaction
A debug message issued when a new MySQL transaction is being started.
This message is typically not issued when inserting data into a
single table because the server doesn't explicitly start
transactions in this case. This message is issued when data is
inserted into multiple tables with multiple INSERT statements
and there may be a need to rollback the whole transaction if
any of these INSERT statements fail.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_COMMIT committing to PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a commit call.  All outstanding transactions will be
committed to the database.  Note that depending on the PostgreSQL settings,
the committal may not include a write to disk.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_DEALLOC_ERROR An error occurred deallocating SQL statements while closing the PostgreSQL lease database: %1
This is an error message issued when a DHCP server (either V4 or V6) experienced
and error freeing database SQL resources as part of closing its connection to
the PostgreSQL database.  The connection is closed as part of normal server
shutdown.  This error is most likely a programmatic issue that is highly
unlikely to occur or negatively impact server operation.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_FATAL_ERROR Unrecoverable PostgreSQL error occurred: Statement: <%1>, reason: %2 (error code: %3).
An error message indicating that communication with the PostgreSQL database server
has been lost.  If automatic recovery has been enabled,  then the server will
attempt to recover the connectivity.  If not the server wil exit with a
non-zero exit code.  The cause of such an error is most likely a network issue
or the PostgreSQL server has gone down.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_ROLLBACK rolling back PostgreSQL database
The code has issued a rollback call.  All outstanding transaction will
be rolled back and not committed to the database.

% DATABASE_PGSQL_START_TRANSACTION starting a new PostgreSQL transaction
A debug message issued when a new PostgreSQL transaction is being started.
This message is typically not issued when inserting data into a
single table because the server doesn't explicitly start
transactions in this case. This message is issued when data is
inserted into multiple tables with multiple INSERT statements
and there may be a need to rollback the whole transaction if
any of these INSERT statements fail.

% DATABASE_TO_JSON_ERROR Internal logic error: uknown %1 element found in state: %2
This error message is printed when conversion to JSON of the internal state is requested,
but the connection string contains unrecognized parameter. This is a programming error.
The software will continue operation, but the returned JSON data will be syntactically
valid, but incomplete. The unknown parameter will not be converted.

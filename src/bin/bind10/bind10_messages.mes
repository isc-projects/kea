% BIND10_CHECK_MSGQ_ALREADY_RUNNING checking if msgq is already running
The boss process is starting up and will now check if the message bus
daemon is already running. If so, it will not be able to start, as it
needs a dedicated message bus.

% BIND10_CONFIGURATION_START_AUTH start authoritative server: %1
This message shows whether or not the authoritative server should be
started according to the configuration.

% BIND10_CONFIGURATION_START_RESOLVER start resolver: %1
This message shows whether or not the resolver should be
started according to the configuration.

% BIND10_INVALID_USER invalid user: %1
The boss process was started with the -u option, to drop root privileges
and continue running as the specified user, but the user is unknown.

% BIND10_KILL_PROCESS killing process %1
The boss module is sending a kill signal to process with the given name,
as part of the process of killing all started processes during a failed
startup, as described for BIND10_KILLING_ALL_PROCESSES

% BIND10_KILLING_ALL_PROCESSES killing all started processes
The boss module was not able to start every process it needed to start
during startup, and will now kill the processes that did get started.

% BIND10_MSGQ_ALREADY_RUNNING msgq daemon already running, cannot start
There already appears to be a message bus daemon running. Either an
old process was not shut down correctly, and needs to be killed, or
another instance of BIND10, with the same msgq domain socket, is
running, which needs to be stopped.

% BIND10_MSGQ_DAEMON_ENDED b10-msgq process died, shutting down
The message bus daemon has died. This is a fatal error, since it may
leave the system in an inconsistent state. BIND10 will now shut down.

% BIND10_MSGQ_DISAPPEARED msgq channel disappeared
While listening on the message bus channel for messages, it suddenly
disappeared. The msgq daemon may have died. This might lead to an
inconsistent state of the system, and BIND 10 will now shut down.

% BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED_NO_EXIT_STATUS process %1 (PID %2) died: exit status not available
The given process ended unexpectedly, but no exit status is
available. See BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED_WITH_EXIT_STATUS for a longer
description.

% BIND10_PROCESS_ENDED_WITH_EXIT_STATUS process %1 (PID %2) terminated, exit status = %3
The given process ended unexpectedly with the given exit status.
Depending on which module it was, it may simply be restarted, or it
may be a problem that will cause the boss module to shut down too.
The latter happens if it was the message bus daemon, which, if it has
died suddenly, may leave the system in an inconsistent state. BIND10
will also shut down now if it has been run with --brittle.

% BIND10_READING_BOSS_CONFIGURATION reading boss configuration
The boss process is starting up, and will now process the initial
configuration, as received from the configuration manager.

% BIND10_RECEIVED_COMMAND received command: %1
The boss module received a command and shall now process it. The command
is printed.

% BIND10_RECEIVED_NEW_CONFIGURATION received new configuration: %1
The boss module received a configuration update and is going to apply
it now. The new configuration is printed.

% BIND10_RECEIVED_SIGNAL received signal %1
The boss module received the given signal.

% BIND10_RESURRECTED_PROCESS resurrected %1 (PID %2)
The given process has been restarted successfully, and is now running
with the given process id.

% BIND10_RESURRECTING_PROCESS resurrecting dead %1 process...
The given process has ended unexpectedly, and is now restarted.

% BIND10_SELECT_ERROR error in select() call: %1
There was a fatal error in the call to select(), used to see if a child
process has ended or if there is a message on the message bus. This
should not happen under normal circumstances and is considered fatal,
so BIND 10 will now shut down. The specific error is printed.

% BIND10_SEND_SIGKILL sending SIGKILL to %1 (PID %2)
The boss module is sending a SIGKILL signal to the given process.

% BIND10_SEND_SIGTERM sending SIGTERM to %1 (PID %2)
The boss module is sending a SIGTERM signal to the given process.

% BIND10_SHUTDOWN stopping the server
The boss process received a command or signal telling it to shut down.
It will send a shutdown command to each process. The processes that do
not shut down will then receive a SIGTERM signal. If that doesn't work,
it shall send SIGKILL signals to the processes still alive.

% BIND10_SHUTDOWN_COMPLETE all processes ended, shutdown complete
All child processes have been stopped, and the boss process will now
stop itself.

% BIND10_START_AS_NON_ROOT starting %1 as a user, not root. This might fail.
The given module is being started or restarted without root privileges.
If the module needs these privileges, it may have problems starting.
Note that this issue should be resolved by the pending 'socket-creator'
process; once that has been implemented, modules should not need root
privileges anymore. See tickets #800 and #801 for more information.

% BIND10_STARTED_PROCESS started %1
The given process has successfully been started.

% BIND10_STARTED_PROCESS_PID started %1 (PID %2)
The given process has successfully been started, and has the given PID.

% BIND10_STARTING starting BIND10: %1
Informational message on startup that shows the full version.

% BIND10_STARTING_PROCESS starting process %1
The boss module is starting the given process.

% BIND10_STARTING_PROCESS_PORT starting process %1 (to listen on port %2)
The boss module is starting the given process, which will listen on the
given port number.

% BIND10_STARTING_PROCESS_PORT_ADDRESS starting process %1 (to listen on %2#%3)
The boss module is starting the given process, which will listen on the
given address and port number (written as <address>#<port>).

% BIND10_STARTUP_COMPLETE BIND 10 started
All modules have been successfully started, and BIND 10 is now running.

% BIND10_STARTUP_ERROR error during startup: %1
There was a fatal error when BIND10 was trying to start. The error is
shown, and BIND10 will now shut down.

% BIND10_STOP_PROCESS asking %1 to shut down
The boss module is sending a shutdown command to the given module over
the message channel.

% BIND10_UNKNOWN_CHILD_PROCESS_ENDED unknown child pid %1 exited
An unknown child process has exited. The PID is printed, but no further
action will be taken by the boss process.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_INIT initializing socket creator parser
The boss module initializes routines for parsing the socket creator
protocol.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_TERMINATE terminating socket creator
The boss module sends a request to terminate to the socket creator.

% BIND10_SOCKET_GET requesting socket [%1]:%2 of type %3 from the creator
The boss forwards a request for a socket to the socket creator.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_EOF eof while expecting data from socket creator
There should be more data from the socket creator, but it closed the socket.
It probably crashed.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_BAD_RESPONSE unknown response for socket request: %1
The boss requested a socket from the creator, but the answer is unknown. This
looks like programmer error.

% BIND10_SOCKET_ERROR error on %1 call in the creator: %2/%3
The socket creator failed to create the requested socket. It failed on the
indicated OS API function with given error.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_BAD_CAUSE unknown error cause from socket creator: %1
The socket creator reported an error when creating a socket. But the function
which failed is unknown (not one of 'S' for socket or 'B' for bind).

% BIND10_SOCKET_CREATED successfully created socket %1
The socket creator successfully created and sent a requested socket, it has
the given file number.

% BIND10_SOCKCREATOR_TRANSPORT_ERROR transport error when talking to the socket creator: %1
Either sending or receiving data from the socket creator failed with the given
error. The creator probably crashed or some serious OS-level problem happened,
as the communication happens only on local host.

    <para>
      libdhcp++ is a library written in C++ that handles
      many DHCP-related tasks, including:

    While this library is currently used by Kea, it is designed to
    be a portable, universal library, useful for any kind of DHCP-related software.

      <title>Interface detection and Socket handling</title>
      <para>Both the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 components share network
      interface detection routines. Interface detection is
      currently supported on Linux, all BSD family (FreeBSD, NetBSD,
      OpenBSD), Mac OS X and Solaris 11 systems.</para>

      <para>DHCPv4 requires special raw socket processing to send and receive
      packets from hosts that do not have IPv4 address assigned. Support
      for this operation is implemented on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.
      It is likely that DHCPv4 component will not work in certain cases on
      other systems.</para>

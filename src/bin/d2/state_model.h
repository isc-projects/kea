/// @brief Implements a finite state machine.
///
/// StateModel is an abstract class that provides the structure and mechanics
/// of a basic finite state machine.
///
/// The state model implementation used is a very basic approach. The model
/// uses numeric constants to identify events and states, and maintains
/// dictionaries of defined events and states.  Event and state definitions
/// include a text label for logging purposes.  Additionally, each state
/// definition includes a state handler. State handlers are methods which
/// implement the actions that need to occur when the model is "in" a given
/// state.  The implementation provides methods to add entries to and verify
/// the contents of both dictionaries.
///
/// During model execution, the following context is tracked:
///
/// * current state - The current state of the model
/// * previous state -  The state the model was in prior to the current state
/// * next event - The next event to be consumed
/// * last event - The event most recently consumed
///
/// When invoked, a state handler determines what it should do based upon the
/// next event including what the next state and event should be. In other
/// words the state transition knowledge is distributed among the state
/// handlers rather than encapsulated in some form of state transition table.
///
/// Events "posted" from within the state handlers are "internally" triggered
/// events.  Events "posted" from outside the state model, such as through
/// the invocation of a callback are "externally" triggered.
///
/// StateModel defines two states:
///
/// * NEW_ST - State that a model is in following instantiation. It remains in
/// this state until model execution has begun.
/// * END_ST - State that a model is in once it has reached its conclusion.
///
/// and the following events:
///
/// * START_EVT - Event used to start model execution.
/// * NOP_EVT - Event used to signify that the model stop and wait for an
/// external event, such as the completion of an asynchronous IO operation.
/// * END_EVT - Event used to trigger a normal conclusion of the model. This
/// means only that the model was traversed from start to finish, without any
/// model violations (i.e. invalid state, event, or transition) or uncaught
/// exceptions.
/// * FAIL_EVT - Event to trigger an abnormal conclusion of the model. This
/// event is posted internally when model execution fails due to a model
/// violation or uncaught exception.  It signifies that the model has reached
/// an inoperable condition.
///
/// Derivations add their own states and events appropriate for their state
/// model.  Note that NEW_ST and END_ST do not support handlers.  No work can
/// be done (events consumed) prior to starting the model nor can work be done
/// once the model has ended.
///
/// Model execution consists of iteratively invoking the state handler
/// indicated by the current state which should consume the next event. As the
/// handlers post events and/or change the state, the model is traversed. The
/// loop stops whenever the model cannot continue without an externally
/// triggered event or when it has reached its final state.  In the case of
/// the former, the loop may be re-entered upon arrival of the external event.
///
/// This loop is implemented in the runModel method.  This method accepts an
/// event as argument which it "posts" as the next event.  It then retrieves the
/// handler for the current state from the handler map and invokes it. runModel
/// repeats this process until it either a NOP_EVT posts or the state changes
/// to END_ST.  In other words each invocation of runModel causes the model to
/// be traversed from the current state until it must wait or ends.
///
/// Re-entering the "loop" upon the occurrence of an external event is done by
/// invoking runModel with the appropriate event.  As before, runModel will
/// loop until either the NOP_EVT occurs or until the model reaches its end.
///
/// A StateModel (derivation) is in the NEW_ST when constructed and remains
/// there until it has been "started".  Starting the model is done by invoking
/// the startModel method which accepts a state as a parameter.  This parameter
/// specifies the "start" state and it becomes the current state.

/// The first task undertaken by startModel is to initialize and verify the
/// the event and state dictionaries.  The following virtual methods are
/// provided for this:
///
/// * defineEvents - define events
/// * verifyEvents - verifies that the expected events are defined
/// * defineStates - defines states
/// * verifyStates - verifies that the expected states are defined
///
/// The concept behind the verify methods is to provide an initial sanity
/// check of the dictionaries.  This should help avoid using undefined event
/// or state values accidentally.
///
/// These methods are intended to be implemented by each "layer" in a StateModel
/// derivation hierarchy.  This allows each layer to define additional events
/// and states.
///
/// Once the dictionaries have been properly initialized, the startModel method
/// invokes runModel with an event of START_EVT.  From this point forward and
/// until the model reaches the END_ST or fails, it is considered to be
/// "running".  If the model encounters a NOP_EVT then it is "running" and
/// "waiting".   If the model reaches END_ST with an END_EVT it is considered
/// "done".  If the  model fails (END_ST with a FAILED_EVT) it is considered
/// "done" and "failed".  There are several boolean status methods which may
/// be used to check these conditions.
///
/// To progress from one state to the another, state handlers invoke use
/// the method, transition.  This method accepts a state and an event as
/// parameters.  These values become the current state and the next event
/// respectively.  This has the effect of entering the given state having posted
/// the given event.  The postEvent method may be used to post a new event
/// to the current state.
///
/// Bringing the model to a normal end is done by invoking the endModel method
/// which transitions the model to END_ST with END_EVT.  Bringing the model to
/// an abnormal end is done via the abortModel method, which transitions the
/// model to END_ST with FAILED_EVT.

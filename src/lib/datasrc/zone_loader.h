    /// informational purposes such as logging.  For example, it shouldn't
    /// be used to determine whether loading is completed by comparing it
    /// to 1.  It should also expect the possibility of getting
    /// \c PROGRESS_UNKNOWN at any call to this method; it shouldn't assume
    /// the specific way of internal implementation as described below (which
    /// is provided for informational purposes only).

    /// In this implementation, if the loader is constructed with a file
    /// name, the progress value is measured by the number of characters
    /// read from the zone file divided by the size of the zone file
    /// (with taking into account any included files).  Note that due to
    /// the possibility of intermediate included files, the total file size
    /// cannot be fully fixed until the completion of the load.  And, due to
    /// this possibility, return values from this method may not always
    /// increase monotonically.
    ///
    /// If it's constructed with another data source client, this method
    /// always returns \c PROGRESS_UNKNOWN; in future, however, it may become
    /// possible to return something more useful, e.g, based on the result
    /// of \c getRRCount() and the total number of RRs if the underlying data

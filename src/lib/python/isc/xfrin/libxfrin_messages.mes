% LIBXFRIN_DIFFERENT_TTL multiple data with different TTLs (%1, %2) on %3/%4. Adjusting %2 -> %1.
The xfrin module received an update containing multiple rdata changes for the
same RRset. But the TTLs of these don't match each other. As we combine them
together, the later one get's overwritten to the earlier one in the sequence.

% LIBXFRIN_NO_JOURNAL disabled journaling for updates to %1 on %2
An attempt was made to create a Diff object with journaling enabled, but
the underlying data source didn't support journaling (while still allowing
updates) and so the created object has it disabled.  At a higher level this
means that the updates will be applied to the zone but subsequent IXFR requests
will result in a full zone transfer (i.e., an AXFR-style IXFR).  Unless the
overhead of the full transfer is an issue this message can be ignored;
otherwise you may want to check why the journaling wasn't allowed on the
data source and either fix the issue or use a different type of data source.

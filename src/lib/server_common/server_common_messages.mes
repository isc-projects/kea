# \brief Messages for the server_common library

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESSES_NOT_LIST the address and port specification is not a list in %1
This points to an error in configuration. What was supposed to be a list of
IP address - port pairs isn't a list at all but something else.

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_FAIL failed to listen on addresses (%1)
The server failed to bind to one of the address/port pair it should according
to configuration, for reason listed in the message (usually because that pair
is already used by other service or missing privileges). The server will try
to recover and bind the address/port pairs it was listening to before (if any).

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_MISSING address specification is missing "address" or "port" element in %1
This points to an error in configuration. An address specification in the
configuration is missing either an address or port and so cannot be used. The
specification causing the error is given in the message.

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_TYPE address specification type is invalid in %1
This points to an error in configuration. An address specification in the
configuration malformed. The specification causing the error is given in the
message. A valid specification contains an address part (which must be a string
and must represent a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address) and port (which must be an
integer in the range valid for TCP/UDP ports on your system).

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_UNRECOVERABLE failed to recover original addresses also (%2)
The recovery of old addresses after SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_FAIL also failed for
the reason listed.

The condition indicates problems with the server and/or the system on
which it is running.  The server will continue running to allow
reconfiguration, but will not be listening on any address or port until
an administrator does so.

% SRVCOMM_ADDRESS_VALUE address to set: %1#%2
Debug message. This lists one address and port value of the set of
addresses we are going to listen on (eg. there will be one log message
per pair). This appears only after SRVCOMM_SET_LISTEN, but might
be hidden, as it has higher debug level.

% SRVCOMM_KEYS_DEINIT deinitializing TSIG keyring
Debug message indicating that the server is deinitializing the TSIG keyring.

% SRVCOMM_KEYS_INIT initializing TSIG keyring
Debug message indicating that the server is initializing the global TSIG
keyring. This should be seen only at server start.

% SRVCOMM_KEYS_UPDATE updating TSIG keyring
Debug message indicating new keyring is being loaded from configuration (either
on startup or as a result of configuration update).

% SRVCOMM_PORT_RANGE port out of valid range (%1 in %2)
This points to an error in configuration. The port in an address
specification is outside the valid range of 0 to 65535.

% SRVCOMM_SET_LISTEN setting addresses to listen to
Debug message, noting that the server is about to start listening on a
different set of IP addresses and ports than before.

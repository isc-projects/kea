# This script is used in a couple of IXFR tests.
#
# Preconditions:\n
# The BIND 9 nameserver (ns1, 10.53.0.1, acting as the IXFR server) is loaded
# with the N-4 version of the zone.  It may hold prior versions as well.
# Notifications are disabled.
#
# The BIND 10 nameserver (nsx2, 10.53.0.2, acting as the IXFR client) is loaded
# with an earlier (unspecified) version of the zone.
#
# Actions:\n
# This script updates the IXFR server with the N-2 and N-0 versions of the zone.
# It then updates the BIND 10 configuration so that it looks for IXFRs from
# the IXFR server and causes the server to send the client a NOTIFY.  After
# waiting for the client to update from the server, it compares SOA serials,
# reporting an error if they are different.
#
# Caller Actions:\n
# The caller can pre-load the BIND 10 IXFR client with whatever version of the
# zone it requires.  It can also load the BIND 9 IXFR server with zones earlier
# than N-4.
#
# After this test has finished, it is up to the caller to check the logs
# to see if they report the expected behavior.
#
# \arg $1 If present (and set to "yes"), after updating the IXFR server,
#      ensure that NOTIFYs are enabled and send a NOTIFY to the slave.
#
# \return 0 if the script executed successfully, non-zero otherwise

# Set up variables etc.

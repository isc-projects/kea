/// @brief Host Manager.
///
/// This is a singleton class which provides access to multiple sources of
/// information about static host reservations. These sources are also referred
/// to as host data sources. Each source derives (directly or indirectly) from
/// the @c BaseHostDataSource.
///
/// The @c HostMgr is a central point for providing information about the host
/// reservations. Internally, it relays the queries (calls to the appropriate
/// methods declared in the @c BaseHostDataSource) to the data sources it is
/// connected to. The @c HostMgr is always connected to the server's
/// configuration, accessible through the @c CfgHosts object in the @c CfgMgr.
/// The @c CfgHosts object holds all reservations specified in the DHCP server
/// configuration file. If a particular reservation is not found in the
/// @c CfgHosts object, the @c HostMgr will try to find it using the alternate
/// host data storage. The alternate host data storage is usually a database
/// (e.g. SQL database), accessible through a dedicated host data source
/// object (a.k.a. database backend). This datasource is responsible for
/// managing the connection with the database and forming appropriate queries
/// to retrieve (or update) the information about the reservations.
///
/// The use of the alternate host data source is optional and usually requires
/// additional configuration to be specified by the server administrator.
/// For example, for the SQL database the user's credentials, database address,
/// and database name are required. The @c HostMgr passes these parameters
/// to an appropriate datasource which is responsible for opening a connection
/// and maintaining it.
///
/// It is possible to switch to a different alternate data source or disable
/// the use of the alternate datasource, e.g. as a result of server's
/// reconfiguration. However, the use of the primary host data source (i.e.
/// reservations specified in the configuration file) can't be disabled.
///
/// @todo Implement alternate host data sources: MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.

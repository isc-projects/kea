Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

``kea-admin`` is a shell script that offers database maintenance. In
particular, it features database initialization, database version
checking, and database schema upgrading.

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

``command``
   Specifies the command to be issued to the servers. It can be one of the
   following:

   ``db-init``
      Initializes a new database schema. This is useful during a new Kea
      installation. The database is initialized to the latest version
      supported by the version of the software being installed.

   ``db-version``
      Reports the database backend version number. This is not necessarily
      equal to the Kea version number, as each backend has its own
      versioning scheme.

   ``db-upgrade``
      Conducts a database schema upgrade. This is useful when upgrading Kea.

   ``lease-dump``
      Dumps the contents of the lease database (for MySQL or
      PostgreSQL backends) to a CSV (comma-separated values) text file. (Support
      for the Cassandra backend has been deprecated.)
      The first line of the file contains the column names. This can be used
      as a way to switch from a database backend to a memfile backend.
      It can also be used as a diagnostic tool, as it provides a
      portable form of the lease data. There are other mandatory arguments
      that must be used together with this command: either ``-4`` or ``-6`` must
      be specified, and either ``-o`` or ``--output`` must be provided.

   ``lease-upload``
      Uploads leases from a CSV (comma-separated values) text file to a MySQL or
      a PostgreSQL lease database. The CSV file needs to be in memfile format.
      There are other mandatory arguments that must be used together with this
      command: either ``-4`` or ``-6`` must be specified,
      and either ``-i`` or ``--input`` must be provided.

   ``stats-recount``
      Recounts lease statistics for a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.

``backend``
   Specifies the backend type. Currently allowed backends are: memfile,
   mysql, and pgsql; cql has been deprecated.

``-h|--host hostname``
   Specifies the hostname when connecting to a database.
   The default value is ``localhost``.

``-i|--input input_file``
   Specifies the CSV (comma-separated values) text file with the leases to be uploaded;
   required for ``lease-upload``.

``-P|--port port``
   Specifies the port when connecting to a database. If not specified,
   the default value chosen by the database client is used.

``-u|--user username``
   Specifies the username when connecting to a database.
   The default value is ``keatest``.

``-p|--password password``
   Specifies the password when connecting to a database.
   If only ``-p`` or ``--password`` is given, the user is prompted for a password.
   If not specified at all, the ``KEA_ADMIN_DB_PASSWORD`` environment variable
   is checked for a value and used if it exists.
   Otherwise the default value of ``keatest`` is used.

``-n|--name database-name``
   Specifies the name of the database to connect to. The
   default value is ``keatest``.

``-d|--directory script-directory``
   Specifies the override scripts directory. That script is used during
   upgrades, database initialization, and possibly other operations.
   The default value is ``(prefix)/share/kea/scripts/``.

``-o|--output output_file``
   Specifies the file to which the lease data will be dumped. Required for
   ``lease-dump``.

``-v|--version``
   Displays the Kea version.

``-V``
   Displays the extended Kea version.

``-4``
   Directs ``kea-admin`` to lease-dump the DHCPv4 leases. Incompatible with
   the -6 option.

``-6``
   Directs ``kea-admin`` to lease-dump the DHCPv6 leases. Incompatible with
   the -4 option.

``-x|--extra``
   Specifies an extra argument to pass to the database command tool e.g.
   to invoke ``mysql`` with the ``--ssl`` argument. This can be repeated
   to pass more than one argument. Quotes are not preserved. Avoid commands
   containing spaces.

``-y|--yes``
    Assume yes on overwriting temporary files.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kea comes with an extensive Kea Administrator Reference Manual that covers
all aspects of running the Kea software - compilation, installation,
configuration, configuration examples, and much more. Kea also features a
Kea Messages Manual, which lists all possible messages Kea can print
with a brief description for each of them. Both documents are
available in various formats (.txt, .html, .pdf) with the Kea
distribution. The Kea documentation is available at
https://kea.readthedocs.io.

Kea source code is documented in the Kea Developer's Guide,
available at https://reports.kea.isc.org/dev_guide/.

The Kea project website is available at https://kea.isc.org.

Mailing Lists and Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two public mailing lists available for the Kea project. **kea-users**
(kea-users at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea users, while **kea-dev**
(kea-dev at lists.isc.org) is intended for Kea developers, prospective
contributors, and other advanced users. Both lists are available at
https://lists.isc.org. The community provides best-effort support
on both of those lists.

ISC provides professional support for Kea services. See
https://www.isc.org/kea/ for details.

/// @brief Configuration Manager
///
/// This singleton class holds the whole configuration for DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
/// servers. It currently holds information about zero or more subnets6.
/// Each subnet may contain zero or more pools. Pool4 and Pool6 is the most
/// basic "chunk" of configuration. It contains a range of assignable
/// addresses.
///
/// Below is a sketch of configuration inheritance (not implemented yet).
/// Let's investigate the following configuration:
///
/// @code
/// preferred-lifetime 500;
/// valid-lifetime 1000;
/// subnet6 2001:db8:1::/48 {
///     pool6 2001::db8:1::1 - 2001::db8:1::ff;
/// };
/// subnet6 2001:db8:2::/48 {
///     valid-lifetime 2000;
///     pool6 2001::db8:2::1 - 2001::db8:2::ff;
/// };
/// @endcode
///
/// Parameters defined in a global scope are applicable to everything until
/// they are overwritten in a smaller scope, in this case subnet6.
/// In the example above, the first subnet6 has preferred lifetime of 500s
/// and a valid lifetime of 1000s. The second subnet has preferred lifetime
/// of 500s, but valid lifetime of 2000s.
///
/// Parameter inheritance is likely to be implemented in configuration handling
/// routines, so there is no storage capability in a global scope for
/// subnet-specific parameters.
///

/// @todo: Implement option definition support

	Configuration of TSIG keys for b10-xfrin has changed; instead of
	specifying the full TSIG key (<name>:<base64>:<algo>) it now expects
	just the name, and uses the global TSIG Key Ring like all the other
	components (configuration list /tsig_keys/keys).
	Note: this is not automatically updated, so if you use TSIG in
	xfrin, you need to update your configuration.

	Note that there are still a few instances where output is printed,
	these shall be addressed separately.
	Note also that, currently, in case it falls back to stdout (such as
	when it cannot connect to b10-cfgmgr), all log messages are always
	printed (including debug messages), regardless of whether -v was
	used. This shall also be addressed in a future change.

	the reconfiguration doesn't block query handling.
	(Multiple Trac tickets up to #2211)

494.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a problem that shutting down BIND 10 kept some of the
	processes alive.  It was two-fold: when the main bind10 process
	started as a root, started b10-sockcreator with the privilege, and
	then dropped the privilege, the bind10 process cannot kill the
	sockcreator via signal any more (when it has to), but it kept
	sending the signal and didn't stop.  Also, when running on Python
	3.1 (or older), the sockcreator had some additional file
	descriptor open, which prevented it from exiting even after the
	bind10 process terminated.  Now the bind10 process simply gives up
	killing a subprocess if it fails due to lack of permission, and it
	makes sure the socket creator is spawned without any unnecessary
	FDs open.

	Memory footprint of the in-memory data source has been
	substantially improved.  For example, b10-auth now requires much

	operation; there's no need to update or change the configuration
	to enable this feature.
	Notes: multiple instances of b10-auth still make separate copies
	of the memory image.  Also, loading zones in memory still suspends
	query processing, so manual reloading or reloading after incoming

	BIND 10 now relies on Boost offset_ptr, which caused some new
	portability issues.  Such issues are detected at ./configure time.
	If ./configure stops due to this, try the following workaround:
	- If it's about the use of mutable for a reference with clang++,
	  upgrade Boost version to 1.44 or higher, or try a different
	  compiler (e.g. g++ generally seems to be free from this issue)
	- If it's about the use of "variadic templates", specify
	  --without-werror so the warning won't be promoted to an error.
	  Specifying BOOST_NO_USER_CONFIG in CXXFLAGS may also work
	  (which would be the case if Boost is installed via pkgsrc)

	b10-cfgmgr now loads its configuration check plugins directly from

443.	[func]*		muks
	The logger now uses a lockfile named `logger_lockfile' that is
	created in the local state directory to mutually separate
	individual logging operations from various processes. This is
	done so that log messages from different processes don't mix
	together in the middle of lines. The `logger_lockfile` is created

	Created a new tool b10-dbutil, that can check and upgrade database
	schemas, to be used when incompatible changes are introduced in the
	backend database schema. Currently it only supports sqlite3 databases.
	Note: there's no schema change that requires this utility as of

	Added a command-line option '--clear-config' to bind10, which causes
	the system to create a backup of the existing configuration database
	file, and start out with a clean default configuration. This can be

	The DataSourceClientContainer class that dynamically loads
	datasource backend libraries no longer provides just a .so file name
	to its call to dlopen(), but passes it an absolute path. This means
	that it is no longer an system implementation detail that depends on
	[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH which file is chosen, should there be multiple
	options (for instance, when test-running a new build while a
	different version is installed).
	These loadable libraries are also no longer installed in the default
	library path, but in a subdirectory of the libexec directory of the
	target ($prefix/libexec/[version]/backends).
	This also removes the need to handle b10-xfin and b10-xfrout as
	'special' hardcoded components, and they are now started as regular
	components as dictated by the configuration of the boss process.

	b10-xfrout could potentially create an overflow response message

	b10-xfrout: ACLs for xfrout can now be configured per zone basis.
	A per zone ACL is part of a more general zone configuration.  A

	> config add Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl
	> config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl[0] {"action": "REJECT"}
	The previous global ACL (query_acl) was renamed to transfer_acl,

	Resolved that the stats module wasn't configurable in bindctl in
	spite of its having configuration items. The configuration part
	was removed from the original spec file "stats.spec" and was
	placed in a new spec file "stats-schema.spec". Because it means
	definitions of statistics items. The command part is still
	there. Thus stats module currently has no its own configuration,
	and the items in "stats-schema.spec" are neither visible nor
	configurable through bindctl. "stats-schema.spec" is shared with
	stats module and stats-httpd module, and maybe with other
	statistical modules in future. "stats.spec" has own configuration

	Solved incorrect datetime of "bind10.boot_time" and also
	added a new command "sendstats" for Bob. This command is
	to send statistics data to the stats daemon immediately.
	The solved problem is that statistics data doesn't surely
	reach to the daemon because Bob sent statistics data to
	the daemon while it is starting. So the daemon invokes the
	command for Bob after it starts up. This command is also
	useful for resending statistics data via bindctl manually.

	src/lib/dns: revised dnssectime functions so that they don't rely
	on the time_t type (whose size varies on different systems, which
	can lead to subtle bugs like some form of "year 2038 problem").

163.	[func]		vorner
	The pimpl design pattern is used in UDPServer, with a shared

	Code specifies the message to be logged via a symbol, and the

	The contents of the dictionary can be replaced at run-time by
	locale-specific messages.  A message compiler program is provided
	to create message header files and supply the default messages.

	Command arguments were not validated internally against their

145.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a new command 'loadzone' for (re)loading a
	specific zone.  The command syntax is generic but it is currently
	only feasible for class IN in memory data source.  To reload a
	zone "example.com" via bindctl, execute the command as follows:
	> Auth loadzone origin = example.com
	(Trac #467 git 4f7e1f46da1046de527ab129a88f6aad3dba7562

144.	[build]		jinmei
	Introduced a workaround for clang++ build on FreeBSD (and probably
	some other OSes).  If building BIND 10 fails with clang++ due to
	a link error about "__dso_handle", try again from the configure
	script with CXX_LIBTOOL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib (the path actually
	doesn't matter; the important part is the -L flag).  This
	workaround is not automatically enabled as it's difficult to
	detect the need for it dynamically, and must be enabled via the
	variable by hand.

	b10-auth: updated query benchmark so that it can test in memory
	data source.  Also fixed a bug that the output buffer isn't
	cleared after query processing, resulting in misleading results
	or program crash.  This is a regression due to change #135.
	(Trac #465, svn r4103)

	b10-auth: Fixed a bug that the authoritative server includes

	change #135. (Trac #462, svn r4081)

140.	[func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:
	  ... "auth.queries.tcp": 1, "auth.queries.udp": 1 ...
	Using the "Auth sendstats" command you can make b10-auth send the
	counters to b10-stats immediately.
	(Trac #347, svn r4026)

139.	[build]		jreed
	Introduced configure option and make targets for generating
	Python code coverage report. This adds new make targets:
	report-python-coverage and clean-python-coverage. The C++
	code coverage targets were renamed to clean-cpp-coverage
	and report-cpp-coverage. (Trac #362, svn r4023)

138.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a configuration interface to support in memory
	data sources.  For example, the following command to bindctl
	will configure a memory data source containing the "example.com"
	zone with the zone file named "example.com.zone":
	> config set Auth/datasources/ [{"type": "memory", "zones": \
	 [{"origin": "example.com", "file": "example.com.zone"}]}]
	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be
	configured explicitly.  To disable it again, specify a null list
	for Auth/datasources:
	> config set Auth/datasources/ []
	Notes: it's currently for class IN only.  The zone files are not
	actually loaded into memory yet (which will soon be implemented).
	This is an experimental feature and the syntax may change in
	future versions.

	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced two template classes RBTree and RBNode
	to provide the generic map with domain name as key and anything as
	the value. Because of some unresolved design issue, the new classes
	are only intended to be used by memory zone and zone table.
	(Trac #397, svn r3890)

130.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced a new class MemoryDataSrc to provide
	the general interface for memory data source.  For the initial
	implementation, we don't make it a derived class of AbstractDataSrc

	consider this as part of the generalization work).

	Output changed to JSON format for consistency. (svn r3694)

122.	[func]		stephen
	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

121.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is

	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

120.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

117.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the

	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

88.	[func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one

	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

83.	[build]*		jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

82.	[func]		jinmei

	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

81.	[func]		jinmei

80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or

	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's
	already running (listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

73.	[bug]		jelte
  	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

71.	[func]		each
  	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

70.	[func]		each
  	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

69.	[func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

68.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c (--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file',
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

67.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.

	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)

65.	[func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

64.	[func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

63.	[func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

62.	[func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

61.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc,bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Trac #136, svn r2147)

54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(),
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process,
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't
	be removed, exit from python.

	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

48.	[func]		jelte

	(svn r2007)

38.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.
	Remove unused socket file when Xfrout process exits. Make sure Xfrout
	exit by itself when it receives SIGINT, instead of being killed by the
	signal SIGTERM or SIGKILL sent from boss.
	(Trac #135, #151, #134, svn r1797)

37.	[build]		jinmei
	Check for the availability of python-config. (Trac #159,

	#109, svn r1985)

32.	[func]*		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
        boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
        headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
        using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)

31.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)

30.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,
	and invalid parameters could cause integer overflow and make the
	library crash. (Trac #177, svn r1806)

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

/// the SIGCHLD signal, which is executed when the child process ends.

/// it. The exit code can be retrieved by the caller using the
/// @c ProcessSpawn::getExitStatus method.

/// This class is made noncopyable so that we don't have attempts
/// to make multiple copies of an object.  This avoid problems
/// with multiple copies of objects for a single global resource
/// such as the SIGCHLD signal handler. In addition making it

same configuration file.  It is possible, though unlikely, that the PID file
is a remnant left behind by a server crash or power failure and the PID
it contains refers to a process other than DHCP_DDNS.  In such an event,
it would be necessary to manually remove the PID file.  The first argument is
the DHCP_DDNS process name, the second contains the PID and PID file.

This is a warning message issued when the DHCP-DDNS server is configured to
listen at an address other than the loopback address (127.0.0.1 or ::1). It is
possible for a malicious attacker to send bogus NameChangeRequests to it and
change entries in the DNS. For this reason, addresses other than the IPv4 or
IPv6 loopback addresses should only be used for testing purposes. A future
version of Kea will implement authentication to guard against such attacks.

% DHCP_DDNS_NO_ELIGIBLE_JOBS although there are queued requests, there are pending transactions for each, Queue count: %1  Transaction count: %2
This is a debug message issued when all of the queued requests represent clients
for which there is a an update already in progress.  This may occur under

corresponding log messages from the listener layer with more details. This may
indicate a network connectivity or system resource issue.

% DHCP_DDNS_QUEUE_MGR_RESUME_ERROR application could not restart the queue manager, reason: %1
This is an error message indicating that DHCP_DDNS's Queue Manager could not
be restarted after stopping due to a full receive queue.  This means that
the application cannot receive requests. This is most likely due to DHCP_DDNS
configuration parameters referring to resources such as an IP address or port,
that is no longer unavailable.  DHCP_DDNS will attempt to restart the queue

/// \brief Test Control class.
///
/// This singleton class is used to run the performance test with
/// with \ref TestControl::run function. This function can be executed
/// multiple times if desired because it resets TestControl's internal
/// state every time it is executed. Prior to running \ref TestControl::run,
/// one must make sure to parse command line options by calling
/// \ref CommandOptions::parse. Failing to do this will result in an exception.
///
/// The following major stages of the test are performed by this class:
/// - set default transaction id and MAC address generators - the generator
/// is an object of \ref TestControl::NumberGenerator type and it provides
/// the custom randomization algorithms,
/// - print command line arguments,
/// - register option factory functions which are used to generate DHCP options
/// being sent to a server,
/// - create the socket for communication with a server,
/// - read packet templates if user specified template files with '-T' command
/// line option,
/// - set the interrupt handler (invoked when ^C is pressed) which makes
/// perfdhcp stop gracefully and print the test results before exiting,
/// - executes an external command (if specified '-w' option), e.g. if user
/// specified -w ./foo in the command line then program will execute
/// "./foo start" at the beginning of the test and "./foo stop" when the test
/// ends,
/// - initialize the Statistics Manager,
/// - executes the main loop:
///   - calculate how many packets must be send to satisfy desired rate,
///   - receive incoming packets from the server,
///   - check the exit conditions - terminate the program if the exit criteria
///   are fulfilled, e.g. reached maximum number of packet drops,
///   - send the number of packets appropriate to satisfy the desired rate,
///   - optionally print intermediate reports,
/// - print statistics, e.g. achieved rate,
/// - optionally print some diagnostics.
///
/// With the '-w' command line option user may specify the external application
/// or script to be executed. This is executed twice, first when the test starts
/// and second time when the test ends. This external script or application must
/// accept 'start' and 'stop' arguments. The first time it is called, it is
/// called with the argument 'start' and the second time with the argument
/// 'stop'.
///
/// The application is executed by calling fork() to fork the current perfdhcp
/// process and then call execlp() to replace the current process image with
/// the new one.
///
/// Option factory functions are registered using
/// \ref dhcp::LibDHCP::OptionFactoryRegister. Registered factory functions
/// provide a way to create options of the same type in the same way.
///  When a new option instance is needed, the corresponding factory
/// function is called to create it. This is done by calling
/// \ref dhcp::Option::factory with DHCP message type specified as one of
///  parameters. Some of the parameters passed to factory function
/// may be ignored (e.g. option buffer).
/// Please note that naming convention for factory functions within this
/// class is as follows:
/// - factoryABC4 - factory function for DHCPv4 option,
/// - factoryDEF6 - factory function for DHCPv6 option,
/// - factoryGHI - factory function that can be used to create either

/// @brief Concrete implementation of a lease database backend using flat file.
///
/// This class implements a lease database backend using CSV files to store
/// DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 leases on disk. The format of the files is determined
/// by the @c CSVLeaseFile4 and @c CSVLeaseFile6 classes.
///
/// In order to obtain good performance, the backend stores leases
/// incrementally, i.e. updates to leases are appended at the end of the lease
/// file. To record the deletion of a lease, the lease record is appended to
/// the lease file with the valid lifetime set to 0. However, this may result
/// in a significant growth of the lease file size over time, because the lease
/// file will contain many entries for each lease. In order to mitigate this
/// problem, the backend implements the Lease File Cleanup mechanism which is
/// described on the Kea wiki:
/// https://gitlab.isc.org/isc-projects/kea/wikis/designs/Lease-File-Cleanup-design.
///
/// The backend installs an @c asiolink::IntervalTimer to periodically execute
/// the @c Memfile_LeaseMgr::lfcCallback. This callback function controls
/// the startup of the background process which removes redundant information
/// from the lease file(s).
///
/// When the backend is starting up, it reads leases from the lease file (one
/// by one) and adds them to the in-memory container as follows:
/// - if the lease record being parsed identifies a lease which is not present
/// in the container, and the lease has valid lifetime greater than 0,
/// the lease is added to the container,
/// - if the lease record being parsed identifies a lease which is present in
/// the container, and the valid lifetime of the lease record being parsed is
/// greater than 0, the lease in the container is updated
/// - if the lease record being parsed has valid lifetime equal to 0, and the
/// corresponding lease exists in the container, the lease is removed from
/// the container.
///
/// After the container holding leases is initialized, each subsequent update,
/// removal or addition of the lease is appended to the lease file
/// synchronously.
///
/// Originally, the Memfile backend didn't write leases to disk. This was
/// particularly useful for testing server performance in non-disk bound
/// conditions. In order to preserve this capability, the new parameter
/// "persist=true|false" has been introduced in the database access string.
/// For example, database access string: "type=memfile persist=true"
/// enables writes of leases to a disk.
///
/// The lease file locations can be specified with the "name=[path]"
/// parameter in the database access string. The [path] is the
/// absolute path to the file (including file name). If this parameter
/// is not specified, the default location in the installation
/// directory is used: <install-dir>/var/lib/kea/kea-leases4.csv and
/// <install-dir>/var/lib/kea/kea-leases6.csv.

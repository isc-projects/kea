This is the source for the BIND 10 suite.

BIND is the popular implementation of a DNS server, developer
interfaces, and DNS tools. BIND 10 is a rewrite of BIND 9 and ISC
DHCP. BIND 10 is written in C++ and Python and provides a modular
environment for serving, maintaining, and developing DNS and DHCP.

This release includes the bind10 master process, b10-msgq message
bus, b10-cmdctl remote control daemon, b10-cfgmgr configuration
manager, b10-stats statistics collection and reporting daemon, and
b10-stats-httpd for HTTP access to XML-formatted stats.

For DNS services, it provides the b10-auth authoritative DNS server
(with SQLite3 and in-memory backends), b10-xfrin IXFR/AXFR inbound
service, b10-xfrout outgoing IXFR/AXFR service, b10-zonemgr secondary
manager, libdns++ library for C++ with a python wrapper, and many
tests and example programs. (It also includes an experimental proof
of concept recursive or forwarding DNS server, b10-resolver.)

BIND 10 also provides experimental DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers,
b10-dhcp4 and b10-dhcp6, a portable DHCP library, libdhcp++, and
a DHCP benchmarking tool, perfdhcp.  In this release of BIND 10,
the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers must be considered experimental.

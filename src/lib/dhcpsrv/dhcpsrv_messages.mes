% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS4_ALLOC_ERROR error during attempt to allocate an IPv4 address: %1
An error occurred during an attempt to allocate an IPv4 address, the
reason for the failure being contained in the message.  The server will
return a message to the client refusing a lease.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS4_ALLOC_FAIL failed to allocate an IPv4 address after %1 attempt(s)
THE DHCP allocation engine gave up trying to allocate an IPv4 address
after the specified number of attempts.  This probably means that the
address pool from which the allocation is being attempted is either
empty, or very nearly empty.  As a result, the client will have been
refused a lease.

This message may indicate that your address pool is too small for the
number of clients you are trying to service and should be expanded.
Alternatively, if the you know that the number of concurrently active
clients is less than the addresses you have available, you may want to
consider reducing the lease lifetime.  In this way, addresses allocated
to clients that are no longer active on the network will become available
available sooner.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS6_ALLOC_ERROR error during attempt to allocate an IPv6 address: %1
An error occurred during an attempt to allocate an IPv6 address, the
reason for the failure being contained in the message.  The server will
return a message to the client refusing a lease.

% DHCPSRV_ADDRESS6_ALLOC_FAIL failed to allocate an IPv6 address after %1 attempt(s)
The DHCP allocation engine gave up trying to allocate an IPv6 address
after the specified number of attempts.  This probably means that the
address pool from which the allocation is being attempted is either
empty, or very nearly empty.  As a result, the client will have been
refused a lease.

This message may indicate that your address pool is too small for the

a request for an IPv6 subnet for the specified address, but no such
subnet exists.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_ONLY_SUBNET4 retrieved subnet %1 for address hint %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv4 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager has
returned the specified IPv6 subnet when given the address hint specified
because it is the only subnet defined.

returned the specified IPv6 subnet when given the address hint specified
as the address is within the subnet.

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6_IFACE selected subnet %1 for packet received over interface %2
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv6 subnet for a packet received over
given interface.  This particular subnet was selected, because it
was specified as being directly reachable over given interface. (see
'interface' parameter in the subnet6 definition).

% DHCPSRV_CFGMGR_SUBNET6_IFACE_ID selected subnet %1 (interface-id match) for incoming packet
This is a debug message reporting that the DHCP configuration manager
has returned the specified IPv6 subnet for a received packet. This particular
subnet was selected, because value of interface-id option matched what was
configured in server's interface-id option for that selected subnet6.
(see 'interface-id' parameter in the subnet6 definition).

% DHCPSRV_CLOSE_DB closing currently open %1 database
This is a debug message, issued when the DHCP server closes the currently
open lease database.  It is issued at program shutdown and whenever

server closes the currently open database, and opens a database using
the new parameters.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE4_SELECT_SKIP Lease4 creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease4_select
hook point sets a skip flag. It means that the server was told that no lease4
should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its database and the client
will get a NAK packet.

% DHCPSRV_HOOK_LEASE6_SELECT_SKIP Lease6 (non-temporary) creation was skipped, because of callout skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on lease6_select
hook point sets a skip flag. It means that the server was told that no lease6
should be assigned. The server will not put that lease in its database and the client
will get a NoAddrsAvail for that IA_NA option.

The parameters for access the lease database were passed to the server through
the named configuration parameter, but the code was expecting them to be
passed via the parameter named "lease-database".  If the database opens
successfully, there is no impact on server operation.  However, as this does
indicate an error in the source code, please submit a bug report.

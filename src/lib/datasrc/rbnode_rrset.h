///
/// This class, derived from AbstractRRset, holds a "const" pointer to the
/// underlying RRset object.  All calls to methods on the class are passed to
/// the underlying object.  However, there are some restrictions:
///
/// - Calls to methods that change attributes of the underlying RRset (such as
///   TTL or Name) cause an exception to be thrown.  The in-memory data source
///   does not allow modification of these attributes.  In theory, it is a bad
///   practice in that it doesn't preserve the assumed behavior of the base
///   class.  In practice, however, it should be acceptable because this
///   class is effectively hidden from applications and will only be given
///   to them as a const pointer to the base class via find() variants.
///   So the application cannot call non const methods anyway unless it
///   intentionally breaks the constness.
///
/// - Calls that add the pointer to the associated RRSIG to the RRset are
///   allowed (even though the pointer is to a "const" RRset).  The reason here
///   is that RRSIGs are added to the in-memory data source after the
///   RBNodeRRset objects have been created.  Thus there has to be the
///   capability of modifying this information.
///
/// The class is not derived from RRset itself to simplify coding: part of the
/// loading of the memory data source is handled in the BIND 10 "libdns++"
/// code, which creates RRsets and passes them to the data source code.  This
/// does not have to be altered if encapsulation, rather than inheritance, is
/// used.
///
/// \note This class is exposed in this separate header file so that test code
/// can refer to its definition, and only for that purpose.  Otherwise this is
/// essentially a private class of the in-memory data source implementation,
/// and an application shouldn't directly refer to this class.
/// 
// Note: non-Doxygen-documented methods are documented in the base class.

	New metrics pkt4-dhcp-disabled, pkt4-raw-received, disabled-by-db,
	disabled-by-ha-local, disabled-by-ha-remote, disabled-by-user, and
	disabled-globally provide monitoring level visibility into the network_state
	manager, and closes a monitoring gap where packets dropped while disabled
	are not counted by any metric.
	While disabled, a WARN log is emitted every DISABLE_WARN_PACKET{4|6}(100)
	dropped packets, in addition to the existing DEBUG log.

2189.	[doc]		tomek
	Security reporting process described in a Github-friendly format.
	There is no new information, mostly pointers to already existing
	documents.
	(Gitlab #3080)

2188.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a race condition in free lease queue allocator.
	(Gitlab #3111)

2187.	[func]		tmark
	To facilitate use in containers, the restriction from listening
	on 0.0.0.0 or :: addresses has been removed from kea-dhcp-ddns.
	The server will now issue a warning if configured to use either
	address.
	(Gitlab #3116)

2186.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed interface redetection which had stopped working since
	Kea 2.3.6.

2185.	[func]		razvan
	Added extended log messages: DHCP4_DISCOVER, DHCP4_REQUEST,
	DHCP6_PROCESS_IA_NA_SOLICIT, DHCP6_PROCESS_IA_PD_SOLICIT, which
	include the hint address in the client request. The log message
	tag DHCP4_LEASE_ADVERT has been renamed to DHCP4_LEASE_OFFER.
	(Gitlab #2918)

2184.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug in evaluated expression parser which was not properly
	handling escaped null characters.
	(Gitlab #3086)

2183.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed a bug where one of the commands that retrieve statistic
	values sent to the kea-ctrl-agent would get an overflow error in
	the response if the inquired statistic was intended to have a big
	integer data type, and if the integer value would not be
	representable on 64 bits. Affected statistics are "total-nas" and
	"total-pds", and the bug only manifests if the inquired pool, or
	the inquired subnet's aggregated pool space, is large enough.
	Prior to this fix, commands would get a correct response over
	unix socket.
	(Gitlab #3068)

Kea 2.5.2 (development) released on September 27, 2023

	(Gitlab #3048)

2180.	[build]		andrei
	Apart from enabling log4cplus's own logging, and adding more
	sanity checks in DNS code, the --enable-debug configure flag
	now also makes the compiler produce more abundant debugging
	information that can be read by a debugger.
	(Gitlab #1520)

2179.	[doc]		piotrek
	Updated Developer's Guide with information about new hook
	point "lease4_offer".
	(Gitlab #3067)

2178.	[doc]		andrei

	be handled using the flex-id library. The configuration examples
	that can help with that are found in the flex-id documentation.
	(Gitlab #181)

2177.	[func]		piotrek
	Implemented new DHCPv4 hook point "lease4_offer".
	The callout is executed after the server has received
	the DHCPDISCOVER and the DHCPOFFER has been constructed
	but not yet sent to the client.
	(Gitlab #3038, #3063)

2176.	[doc]		piotrek, razvan
	Updated ARM docs with new configuration key "output-options" and

	client and the transaction identification information
	for received queries between message unpacking and
	first classification.
	(Gitlab #2854)

2173.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed a sporadic failure of IOSignaltest.mixedSignals
	unit test.  Test no longer relies on signals arriving
	in order they are sent as it cannot be guaranteed.
	(Gitlab #2954)

2172.	[func]		fdupont
	Completed and improved logs showing what client classes
	are assigned to queries during processing.
	(Gitlab #2908)

Kea 2.5.0 (development) released on July 26, 2023

	Applied a workaround in the connection to MySQL that prevents
	potential crashes in libmysqlclient library when connection
	to the database is lost and re-established.
	(Gitlab #2792)

2168.	[func]		fdupont
	Cross-reference tables to bind relay and remote
	identifiers from extended info of DHCPv6 leases
	were added to SQL backends. A new command
	"extended-info6-upgrade" (re)builds these tables
	making leases visible to Bulk Lease Queries.
	(Gitlab #2869)

2167.   [func]      tmark
	The kea-dhcp<4/6> parameter, ddns-use-conflict-resolution,
	has been deprecated and replaced with
	ddns-conflict-resolution-mode.  The new parameter supports
	four modes of behavior pertaining to DDNS update conflict
	resolution: check-with-dhcid, no-check-with-dhcid,
	check-exists-with-dhcid, and no-check-without-dhcid.
	Thanks to Shawn Routhier from Infoblox for contributing
	the patch to implement this feature.

2161.	[doc]		fdupont
	Clarified how Kea treats situations where there are multiple
	reservations for the same host.
	(Gitlab #2745)

2160.	[doc]		tomek
	Added clarification about RFC3046 (Relay agent option) support,
	with some examples how to use its content.
	(Gitlab #2887)

2159.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a crash when splitting long options or sending user defined
	options when multi-threading is enabled. Also fixed some cases
	when options are not properly split if the serialized data
	reaches the end of the 255 bytes long boundary.
	(Gitlab #2942)

2158.	[func]		piotrek
	A new command named "reservation-get-by-address" is now available
	in the host_cmds hook library. It returns all host reservations
	for given IP address either in all subnets or in a given subnet.
	(Gitlab #2795)

2157.	[func]*		fdupont
	Added a warning issued when the configuration contains subnets
	without explicit subnet identifiers (without "id" entry). The
	auto-generated subnet identifiers are now deprecated.
	(Gitlab #2866)

2156.	[func]		razvan
	Added an optional 'pool-id' parameter that can be used to enable
	per-pool statistics. Supported by kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 for all
	pool types.
	(Gitlab #2898)

2155.	[func]		fdupont, tomek
	Added the config-hash-get command which returns the
	SHA-256 hash of the current configuration, helping
	in detecting changes. Updated config-get, config-set
	commands to also return SHA-256 hash.
	(Gitlab #2707)

2154.	[doc]		darren
	Corrected minor typo in table in section 8.2.10 of the ARM where
	type was shown as ipv6-address and should have said ipv4-address.
	(Gitlab #2913)

2153.	[doc]		darren
	Changed wording of documentation of ip-reservations-unique
	flag to clarify which host reservation backends support false.
	(Gitlab #2900)

2152.	[doc]		razvan
	Added documentation and unittests for counters by pool ID.
	(Gitlab #145, #2883)

2151.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in the host manager that affected getting a host
	by an IPv6 address or delegated prefix. This query returned only
	partial host information. It lacked other IPv6 reservations and
	some DHCP options.
	(Gitlab #2931)

2150.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in encapsulating DHCP options fetched from the config
	backend. The suboptions are now included in the top-level options
	they belong to.
	(Gitlab #2881)

2149.	[doc]		andrei
	The vendor options documentation has been improved.
	(Gitlab #2793)

2148.	[build]		tmark
	The include file, cfg_globals.h, has been added to the
	to dhcpsrv/Makefile.am such that it now gets installed.
	Prior to this it was omitted from installation.
	(GitLab #2608)

2147.	[doc]		andrei
	There are now more cross-references in the ARM. Commands and hook
	libraries link to their own section. Programs link to their
	manual pages.
	(Gitlab #2554)

2146.	[func]		piotrek
	Making DHCP4_PACKET_DROP_* and DHCP6_PACKET_DROP_* debug prints
	more verbose. The prints are including now hwaddr for DHCP4 and
	duid for DHCP6.
	(Gitlab #2865)

2145.	[bug]		piotrek
	Fixed a bug in kea-admin script where lack of lease type argument
	was not caught correctly and kea-lfc was called without -4 or -6
	DHCP version.
	(Gitlab #2855)

Kea 2.3.8 (development) released on May 31, 2023

2144.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped up for the Kea 2.3.8
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2885)

2143.	[func]		razvan
	Added v4 statistic counters per pool:
	subnet[id].pool[id].assigned-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].cumulative-assigned-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].declined-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].reclaimed-declined-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].reclaimed-leases
	subnet[id].pool[id].total-addresses
	Added v6 statistic counters per pool:
	subnet[id].pool[id].assigned-nas
	subnet[id].pd-pool[id].assigned-pds
	subnet[id].pool[id].cumulative-assigned-nas
	subnet[id].pd-pool[id].cumulative-assigned-pds
	subnet[id].pool[id].declined-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].reclaimed-declined-addresses
	subnet[id].pool[id].reclaimed-leases
	subnet[id].pd-pool[id].reclaimed-leases
	subnet[id].pool[id].total-nas
	subnet[id].pd-pool[id].total-pds
	Counters are stored in the lease storage and after schema
	upgrade all existing leases are considered to be part of pool
	ID 0. On lease update, the counters will be updated accordingly
	including pool IDs and statistics will converge to real values
	over time.
	(Gitlab #145)

2142.	[func]		piotrek
	New command option was added to perfdhcp: --or.
	It allows to insert extra option(s) to relayed DHCPv6 message
	at given level of encapsulation. For now only the first level of
	encapsulation is supported.
	(Gitlab #2834)

2141.	[bug]		razvan
	The High Availability hook library is sending the 'origin'
	parameter set to 'ha-partner' when sending lease update
	commands which enables the forensic log hook library to
	distinguish between administrator commands and HA partner
	commands.
	(Gitlab #2629)

2140.	[func]		slawek
	Implemented functions to delete the host reservations from the
	JSON configuration. Updated the host manager to fully support
	altering the primary source (JSON configuration). Its methods
	accept a new argument ("operation target") to specify the data
	source (JSON configuration and/or hosts database) to query or
	alter. Fixed a function that retrieves IPv6 host reservations
	from the configuration by address.
	(Gitlab #2815)

2139.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in the delegated prefix permutations that caused
	allocating prefixes in the same order by the random and FLQ
	allocators.
	(Gitlab #2860)

2138.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in the DHCPv4 server that sent DHCPNAK to a client
	in the INIT-REBOOT state when the server had no matching subnet
	configuration for that client.
	(Gitlab #2858)

2137.	[func]		fdupont
	A new command "extended-info4-upgrade" makes old leases
	from SQL DHCPV4 lease database visible to Bulk Lease Queries.
	(Gitlab #2757)

2136.	[func]		tmark
	The default value, in kea-dhcp6, for preferred-lifetime is
	now calculated as: 0.625 * valid-lifetime. This calculation
	is also used in the event that the specified value for
	preferred-lifetime is greater than valid-lifetime.  Prior to
	this, the default value was 3600 seconds, and there was no
	check against sending values greater than valid-lifetime.
	(Gitlab #2835)

2135.	[build]		tomek
	The CodeQL pipeline has been enabled on github. Developer's guide
	updated with details.
	(Gitlab #2760)

2134.	[func]		andrei
	Statistics total-nas and total-pds were increased from 64-bit
	values to 128-bit values to accurately represent large pools.
	(Gitlab #2658)

2133.	[func]		andrei
	Added missing YANG nodes: allocator, ddns-ttl-percent,
	exclude-first-last-24, ignore-dhcp-server-identifier,
	offer-lifetime, pd-allocator, read-timeout, tcp-user-timeout,
	write-timeout.
	Removed obsolete YANG nodes: contact-points, keyspace.
	(Gitlab #2832)

2132.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in the allocation engine that could cause an invalid
	lease assignment in the shared networks using subnets with
	different allocator types.
	(Gitlab #2843)

2131.	[bug]		razvan
	Added support for 255 bytes long client-id and 130 bytes long
	duid (2 bytes for type and at most 128 bytes for value).
	(Gitlab #2786)

2130.	[func]		piotrek
	Added support of DHCP Options for the Discovery of
	Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) as per draft-ietf-add-dnr.
	Kea can now handle DHCPv4 Option code 162 and DHCPv6 Option
	code 144.
	(Gitlab #2536)

2129.	[func]		andrei
	New statistics were added to keep track of leases that have their
	CLTT increased in memory and their expiration time left unchanged
	in persistent storage as part of the lease caching feature. The
	statistics are: v4-lease-reuse, subnet[id].v4-lease-reuse,
	v6-ia-na-lease-reuse, subnet[id].v6-ia-na-lease-reuse,
	v6-ia-pd-lease-reuse, subnet[id].v6-ia-pd-lease-reuse.
	(Gitlab #2797)

2128.	[bug]*		razvan
	In addition to logging them, the server now sets the
	CalloutHandle status to DROP to indicate an error occurred when
	it catches unhandled exceptions thrown by a callout.
	(Gitlab #2805)

Kea 2.3.7 (development) released on April 26, 2023

2127.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped up for the Kea 2.3.7
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2837)

2126.	[func]		andrei
	A new command named reservation-update is now available in the
	host_cmds hook library. It updates an existing reservation.
	(Gitlab #549)

2125.	[func]		marcin
	Allocators can now be configured in the configuration backend.
	(Gitlab #2823)

2124.	[perf]		andrei
	When not explicitly configured, multi-threading mode and the HTTP
	dedicated listener are enabled by default for the
	high-availability hook library ("enable-multi-threading" and
	"http-dedicated-listener" set to true).
	(Gitlab #2749)

2123.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug which was truncating relay suboptions (circuit-id
	code 1 and remote-id code 2) if the data ended in 0x0. The
	option definitions have been updated from OPT_STRING_TYPE to
	OPT_BINARY_TYPE.
	(Gitlab #2794)

2122.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in the HA hook library whereby the HA service could
	sometimes terminate even after the partner's clock has been
	corrected. The last clock skew is now ignored when a
	communication failure with the partner occurs.
	(Gitlab #2754)

2121.	[func]		marcin
	Implemented Free Lease Queue allocator. It can be used for
	address assignment in DHCPv4 and prefix delegation in DHCPv6.
	The allocator is suitable when the DHCP servers work with
	nearly depleted pools, and the time to find an available
	lease becomes long with other allocators. The new allocator,
	however, slows down the server startup and reconfiguration.
	It also uses more memory.
	(Gitlab #2780, #2764)

Kea 2.3.6 (development) released on March 29, 2023

2120.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped up for the Kea 2.3.6
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2807)

2119.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new parameter, ddns-ttl-percent, to kea-dhcp4
	and kea-dhcp6, that may be used to calculate DNS TTL
	as a simple percentage of the lease life time.
	(Gitlab #225)

2118.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug which was changing the multi-threading settings when
	running config-test command and the settings were different from
	the server's configuration. This also fixes the rollback on the
	multi-threading settings if there is a configuration error
	detected. Also hooks now set DROP flag on the
	dhcp4_srv_configured and dhcp6_srv_configured callouts if the
	configuration is invalid or an error occured. Proper shutdown
	of the HTTP listener is performed now instead of generating a
	server crash if the provided address is not valid.
	(Gitlab #2799)

2117.	[func]		fdupont
	Added a new ignore-dhcp-server-identifier DHCPv4 compatibility
	flag which when set to true (default is false) makes any query
	to be accepted even when the address in the DHCP Server
	Identifier option belongs to another server (standard behavior
	is to drop such queries).
	(Gitlab #2785)

2116.	[func]		piotrek
	Added support of Secure Zero Touch Provisioning options as per
	RFC8572. Kea can now handle DHCPv4 Option code #143 and DHCPv6
	Option code #136.
	(Gitlab #939)

2115.	[func]		tmark
	Added the parameter, offer-lifetime, to kea-dhcp4.  When
	greater than zero, the server temporarily allocates and
	persists leases during DHCPOFFER processing.
	(Gitlab #2719)

2114.	[func]		razvan
	Added the -T command line parameter to kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6
	for testing configuration files, similar to -t, but with extra
	checks like checking database connections, checking hook
	libraries parameters, and others.
	(Gitlab #1671)

2113.	[bug]		razvan
	The reload functionality (by sending SIGHUP) of the kea-dhcp4
	and kea-dhcp6 servers has been enhanced to rollback to
	previously working configuration if the new configuration is
	invalid. There are still cases that can leave the server in an
	unrecoverable state, and such case is indicated by a FATAL
	log message. The same logic applies to the "config-set" command
	available to the server through the control channel.
	(Gitlab #2722)

2112.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added in the ARM security a section explaining how
	to tune the OpenSSL configuration file for Kea service
	accepting commands over HTTPS.
	(Gitlab #2784)

2111.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed a bug which advertised re-assigned released leases
	with zero lifetimes.
	(Gitlab #2766)

2110.	[func]		fdupont
	A new boolean configuration flag called "never-send" has been
	added to the option data scope. When enabled, the option is not
	sent in a response to the client, even if the client explicitly
	requests it.
	(Gitlab #719)

2109.	[bug]		fdupont
	Compatibility flags e.g. lenient-option-parsing were not
	saved by config-get and similar commands.
	(Gitlab #2790)

2108.	[func]		fdupont
	Added a new exclude-first-last-24 DHCPv4 compatibility flag
	which when set to true (default is false) skips addresses
	in .0 and .255 in subnets with prefix length less than 24
	in the allocation engine routine picking a free address.
	(Gitlab #720)

2107.	[func]		fdupont
	The Kea DHCPv4 server can now handle multiple vivco-suboptions
	options with different enterprise IDs.
	(Gitlab #467)

2106.	[bug]		tmark
	Corrected code that allowed lease6-get-* commands to return
	IA_NA leases with prefix length values of zero and logic in
	kea-dhcp6 that was incorrectly generating duplicate iaaddr
	options with lifetimes of zero for such leases in REPLYs to
	RENEWs.
	(Gitlab #2660)

2105.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp6 now consistently uses valid and preferred lifetime
	values provided via classes.  Prior to this it was not
	utilizing class-supplied lifetimes when renewing existing
	leases or when reusing expired leases.
	(Gitlab #2739)

Kea 2.3.5 (development) released on February 22, 2023

2104.	[build]		andrei
	The library version numbers have been bumped up for the Kea 2.3.5
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2768)

2103.	[perf]		andrei
	When not explicitly configured, multi-threading is now enabled by
	default for the core Kea DHCP service ("enable-multi-threading"
	set to true). For now, HA+MT is still disabled by default
	("enable-multi-threading" and "http-dedicated-listener" both
	still set to false in the high-availability library parameters).
	(Gitlab #2402)

2102.	[func]*		tmark
	The logger to which kea-dhcp4 now logs EVAL_RESULT log
	messages issued during packet classification has been
	changed from "options4" to "dhcp4".  This corrects an
	inconsistency between kea-dhcp6 and kea-dhcp4 behavior.
	(Gitlab #2720)

2101.	[build]		andrei
	Shell tests and python tests no longer run if gtest is disabled.
	This provides the ability to run distcheck without tests.
	(Gitlab #2742)

2100.	[doc]		Kevin P. Fleming
	Fixed several JSON examples in the Kea ARM.
	(Gitlab #2494)

2099.	[func]*		tmark
	An address reserved in a global reservation must now lie
	within the range of the subnet or shared-network selected
	by Kea. If it does not, the server will attempt to allocate an
	address dynamically. This change applies to both kea-dhcp4 and
	kea-dhcp6. Previously, the servers would grant a lease for any
	globally reserved address without regard for its feasibility
	within the selected subnet. Thanks to Kyle Birkeland for
	reporting the issue and contributing the patch.
	(Gitlab #2631, #2632)

2098.	[doc]		razvan
	Updated client classification examples in the ARM with a case
	where both operands of the evaluated expression are computed at
	runtime.
	(Gitlab #2664)

2097.	[func]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 will now accept renew-timer values that
	exceed rebind-timer values but will ignore them and issue a
	warning. Previously, the servers treated those values as a fatal
	configuration error.
	(Gitlab #2677)

2096.	[bug]		tmark
	Corrected a bug which allowed options to be added to themselves
	as suboptions.
	(Gitlab #2538)

2095.	[bug]		marcin, tmark
	Added a compile-time check of whether the PostgreSQL version
	supports the "tcp-user-timeout" parameter. This parameter
	is available in PostgreSQL version 12 and later. It is now
	ignored for earlier versions and a suitable warning message
	is issued.
	(Gitlab #2734)

2094.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug which caused the Kea server to crash when
	using the high-availability hooks library and running reconfigure
	commands. Thanks to Caciano Machado for reporting this bug and
	providing detailed steps on how to replicate it.
	(Gitlab #2575)

2093.	[func]		fdupont
	It is now possible to add an "empty" host reservation without any
	attribute (e.g. no address, no hostname, no client classes,
	etc.). This is useful for determining the KNOWN class.
	(Gitlab #2723)

2092.	[bug]		fdupont
	Added logic to kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 to catch and log
	database connection errors that occur during lease
	reclamation. Previously, such errors caused the
	reclamation timer to not get rescheduled.
	(Gitlab #2682)

2091.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug that caused a response to a config-get command
	to lack the configured read-timeout, write-timeout, and
	tcp-user-timeout parameters.
	(Gitlab #2741)

2090.	[build]		andrei
	Fixed the --with-site-packages configure flag, which previously
	had no effect.
	(Gitlab #2669)

Kea 2.3.4 (development) released on January 25, 2023

2089.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.3.4
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2726)

2088.	[func]*		tomek
	The libreload command is now deprecated. The code is still there,
	but it will be removed in the future versions.
	(Gitlab #2693)

2087.	[func]		razvan
	The Kea DHCPv4 server can now handle multiple vendor options
	with different enterprise IDs and multiple vivso-suboptions.
	(Gitlab #1518)

2086.	[bug]		andrei
	A spacing issue in a prepared statement that prevented Config
	Backend from working with PostgreSQL 15 and above has been fixed.
	(Gitlab #2724)

2085.	[func]		tmark
	kea-dhcp-ddns uses new log messages to clearly distinguish
	between timeouts and other IO errors when communicating with
	DNS servers.
	(Gitlab #2589)

2084.	[func]		razvan
	When the client adds a prefix length in the hint, the server
	will try to select a pool with the delegated prefix length
	equal to the respective value. If no pool is found, the server
	will try to select a pool with a lower delegated prefix length
	(a larger address space) and if none is found, it will try to
	select a pool with a higher delegated prefix length (a smaller
	address space).
	(Gitlab #1958)

2083.	[func]		marcin
	New database connection parameters, "read-timeout" and
	"write-timeout", control the timeouts in communication with the
	MySQL database. The "tcp-user-timeout" controls the timeout in
	communication with the PostgreSQL database. Setting these
	timeouts can prevent occasional Kea hangs due to issues with
	the database connectivity.
	(Gitlab #2688)

2082.	[bug]		razvan
	The prefix address provided in the prefix and prefix length pair
	from the pool configuration is now checked to match the first
	address in the pool.
	(Gitlab #2612)

2081.	[func]		tmark
	The default value for the kea-dhcp-ddns parameter,
	dns-server-timeout, has been increased from 100 ms to
	500 ms.  This was done to improve the out-of-the-box
	user experience.
	(Gitlab #2590)

2080.	[func]		tmark
	Bulk Lease Query results can now include delegated prefixes.
	Memfile queries used by Bulk Lease Query (BLQ) were modified
	to include delegated prefixes when appropriate. Prior to
	this they were returning only address leases.
	(Gitlab #2713)

2079.	[func]		marcin
	The lease allocation strategy is now configurable. It is possible
	to select between iterative and random lease selection for the
	address assignment and prefix delegation, respectively, at the
	global, shared network, and subnet levels.
	(Gitlab #2348, #969)

Kea 2.3.3 (development) released on November 30, 2022

2078.	[build]		andrei
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.3.3
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2650)

2077.	[func]		andrei
	YANG modules have been updated with three configuration nodes:
	extended-info-checks, ignore-rai-link-selection, template-test.
	keatest-module has also gained empty, leafref and union nodes for
	proper testing of all YANG leaf types.
	Additionally, stable libyang and sysrepo versions are recommended
	for use in the ARM in place of the previous development versions.
	(Gitlab #2601)

2076.	[doc]		razvan
	Add documentation for template classes and the new parameter
	'template-test' which evaluates to a string value. This indicates
	if the class is spawning classes with the name containing the
	evaluated value: 'SPAWN_<template-class-name>_<evaluated-value>'
	only if the value is not empty string. This will also add the
	packet to the <template-class-name> class.
	(Gitlab #2606)

2075.	[bug]		razvan
	The builtin client class ALL can now be used again to apply lease
	limits and rate limits.
	(Gitlab #2615)

2074.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new library, libkea_tcp, that provides support for a
	generic TCP listener.  Initially, this library will be used
	for Bulk LeaseQuery
	(Gitlab #2583)

Kea 2.3.2 (development) released on October 26, 2022

2073.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.3.2
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2607)

2072.	[func]		razvan
	If both "flush-reclaimed-timer-wait-time" and
	"hold-reclaimed-time" are non-zero, when the client sends a
	release message the lease is expired. Previously it was deleted
	from the lease storage. The default values are 25 and 3600
	respectively, effectively changing the default server behavior.
	(Gitlab #2548)

2071.	[perf]		andrei
	Significantly improved the performance of editing configuration
	with kea-netconf. Instead of making a request to the sysrepo
	datastore for each leaf and leaf-list node, a single request is
	done and the config is translated from the received data node.
	This approach is considered experimental.
	(Gitlab #2400)

2070.	[func]		andrei
	kea-netconf now requires libyang v2 and sysrepo v2 to compile and
	run. Support for libyang v1 and sysrepo v1 has been dropped.
	(Gitlab #2311)

2069.	[func]		fdupont
	Added a new sanity checker named "extended-info-checks"
	which checks and eventually upgrades lease extended
	info which store into lease user context in DHCPv4
	the dhcp-agent-options content and in DHCPv6 the
	relay-msg fields and options.
	(Gitlab #2595)

2068.	[func]		djt
	Kea's official APK, Deb, and RPM packages have been restructured
	and made to follow a consistent packaging standard. Some of the
	package names have been modified, and some packages have been
	consolidated into larger packages as a result of these changes.
	Kea now runs under a service user on RPM systems. Upgrading Kea
	on Debian and Ubuntu systems should be done with ``apt
	dist-upgrade`` when upgrading to this release or later, as some
	packages need to be removed before being reinstalled. Depending
	on how Kea was installed, upgrading to this release or later on
	Debian or Ubuntu systems could cause the DHCPv6 and/or the DDNS
	server, as well as the open-source hooks to be removed. In order
	to ensure they are properly installed, either install the
	``isc-kea`` metapackage, or install the packages explicitly by
	name. Further details can be found in the Gitlab issue.
	(Gitlab #2220)

2067.	[func]		fdupont
	Updated the layout of extended information optionally
	stored in lease user context to add remote and relay
	identifier (sub-)options.
	(Gitlab #2587)

2066.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed lease reuse process to clear the user context
	when the lease expired and was reclaimed.
	(Gitlab #2588)

2065.	[func]		djt
	A compatibility config option called ignore-rai-link-selection
	has been added to the DHCPv4 config allow operators to ignore
	Link Selection suboption data in Relay Agent information options.
	When this configuration value is set to true, Kea will no longer
	use data provided in the suboption for subnet selection.
	(Gitlab #2543)

Kea 2.3.1 (development) released on September 28, 2022

2064.	[build]		mgodzina
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.3.1
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2576)

2063.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed 32 bit compatibility issue with PostgreSQL time.
	(Gitlab #2532)

2062.	[func]		fdupont
	The lease_cmds hook library supports two new commands
	"lease4-write" and "lease6-write" which should help
	to recover emergency situations e.g. full disk space
	by writing the memory lease database into a CSV file.
	They are supported only by the memfile backend.
	(Gitlab #1654)

2061.	[bug]*		fdupont
	Enforce length limits on host identifier (20 bytes for
	hardware address, 128 bytes for DUID and other types).
	(Gitlab #2557)

2060.	[build]		andrei
	Two scripts that are used for checking YANG modules now
	automatically detect the location of the yanglint tool and its
	libraries based on the values passed to the configure script.
	"make check" should now pass uninterrupted on some delicate
	systems like Alpine and RPM-based. Also, reinstall.sh, used to
	install YANG modules, now detects sysrepoctl automatically.
	(Gitlab #2558)

2059.	[func]		marcin
	The lease_cmds hook library returns a new "conflict" status
	code indicating an issue with a lease update due to a mismatch
	between the received lease and the server's configuration or
	state. The HA hook library differentiates between this new
	status and a general error and avoids transitioning to the
	partner-down state when conflicts occur. The new
	"max-rejected-lease-updates" parameter sets a limit for the
	maximum number of conflicts before the server terminates the
	HA service.
	(Gitlab #2408)

2058.	[build]		fdupont
	kea-lfc is now built just after libraries.
	(Gitlab #2526)

2057.	[doc]		marcin
	Fixed broken example and documentation for long DHCPv4 options
	in the ARM.
	(Gitlab #2545)

2056.	[build]		andrei
	Improved build compatibility in Kea between g++ and Boost
	libraries. The compilation error that was fixed was reported to
	occur with g++ 8 and boost 1.75. The fix consists of passing
	callbacks directly to boost::asio::io_service::post and not
	indirectly through a functor. Thanks to rski for reporting the
	error and suggesting the fix!
	(Gitlab #2519)

2055.	[func]		andrei
	When Kea starts with an erroneous file configuration, if the
	logging is viable and is configured to log at least at ERROR
	level, it will log the errors according to the configured
	logging. Previously, it would log them in stderr which made
	gathering of the errors more difficult. A final log message is
	still logged at stderr just as before.
	(Gitlab #1955)

Kea 2.3.0 (development) released on August 31, 2022

2054.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.3.0
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2546)

2053.	[doc]		razvan
	A new appendix for configuration templates added to Kea ARM.
	which include High Availability with multi-threading and secure
	connections using TLS.
	(Gitlab #2441)

2052.	[func]		andrei
	Omitted logger configuration entries are now properly inherited
	from the root logger as the ARM suggests.
	(Gitlab #2537)

2051.	[func]		razvan
	Added support for bulk lease query options defined in RFC 6926.
	The bulk lease query functionality has not been implemented yet.
	(Gitlab #2527)

2050.	[build]		andrei, tomek
	Fixed problem with preparing system using hammer on FreeBSD
	13.0. The available sphinx and python versions are now detected
	dynamically. This should prevent future package upgrades (e.g.
	to python 3.10) from breaking our builds again.
	(Gitlab #2534)

2049.	[build]		razvan, fdupont
	The distcheck rule is able to compile and run unittests for
	database backends, GSS-TSIG and Sysrepo/NETCONF.
	(Gitlab #2071)

2048.	[bug]		fdupont
	Set broadcast MAC destination address in DHCPv4 replies
	when the IP address is broadcast. Thanks to Joost Bekkers
	for reporting the issue and contributing the patch.  This
	improves Kea's compatibility with Cisco Small Business
	switches.
	(Gitlab #2211)

2047.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support of multiple instances of the DHCPv6
	"vendor-class" (code 16) and "vendor-opts" (code 17)
	options: specifying multiple options with different
	enterprise numbers is now supported by Kea.

2046.	[doc]		andrei
	Disabled smart quotes in Sphinx configuration to leave quotes
	unchanged. Prior to this change, quotes were converted into
	left-quotes and right-quotes. This made it difficult for users to
	copy and use chunks of configuration directly from the ARM.
	(Gitlab #2513)

Kea 2.2.0 (stable) released on July 27, 2022

2045.	[build]		tmark
	Bumped library version numbers for the Kea 2.2.0 stable release.
	(Gitlab #2504)

	Modified indexes on the hosts table in the postgresql
	schema to improve performance on host reservation searches.
	Thanks to Paul Kutzer for suggesting these changes.
	(Gitlab #2452)

2043.	[func]		andrei
	The status-get command now shows the status of the sockets being
	opened to receive DHCP requests, and a list of errors for the
	sockets that were not successfully created.
	(Gitlab #2434)

2042.	[func]		razvan
	Added missing parameters to YANG modules, including TLS
	parameters for database connections.
	(Gitlab #2224)

2041.	[bug]		tmark
	HA now applies load balancing and scoping only to inbound
	client packet types that apply to client lease fulfillment,
	e.g. DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPREQUEST, DHCPV6_SOLICIT, DHCPV6_REQUEST,
	etc. Previously, HA indiscriminately balanced and
	scoped all inbound packets, including those related to lease
	query.
	(Gitlab #1781)

2040.	[func]		djt
	Added support for Alpine 3.16 in hammer.py.
	(Gitlab #2491)

2039.	[doc]		andrei
	Updated the limits hook library ARM documentation to reflect
	support for lease limits.
	(Gitlab #2481)

2038.	[func]		djt
	Added a new statistic to kea-dhcp4 that counts host
	reservation conflicts. They are now tracked at both
	the global and subnet levels, as v4-reservation-conflicts
	and subnet[id].v4-reservation-conflicts, respectively.
	(Gitlab #2419)

2037.	[bug]		razvan, marcin
	Fixed a crash in the HA+MT scenario caused by a race condition
	which occurred between resetting the CalloutHandle state and
	accessing the hook point parameters, from different threads,
	when unparking packets.
	(Gitlab #2473)

2036.	[build]		andrei
	Added a tool that checks whether there are any missing REST
	commands from the API Reference section of the ARM.
	See tools/check-for-missing-api-commands.sh.
	It has been integrated into the Gitlab CI and runs on every
	push.
	(Gitlab #2379)

2035.	[doc]		Daniel Bjors

	and Lease6CollectionPtr types. Thanks to Daniel Bjors for
	reporting this typo.
	(Gitlab #2447)

2034.	[func]		andrei
	The PostgreSQL schema has been changed to provide initial support
	for the lease-limiting feature, part of the limits hook library.
	(Gitlab #2445)

2033.	[func]		tmark
	Functionality needed to support the lease-limiting feature of

	recover system error messages.
	(Gitlab #1614)

2030.	[doc]		fdupont, tomek
	GSS-TSIG examples updated. The recommendation to not use
	client-keytab and credentials-cache at the same time added.
	(Gitlab #2247)

2029.	[bug]		fdupont
	The check of the subnet id in configuration is stricter:
	values outside the 0..4294967295 are rejected. Note that
	the value 0 means to leave Kea to assign itself the id.
	(Gitlab #2086)

2028.	[build]		orbea, fdupont
	Compatibility with LibreSSL 3.5.2 improved.
	(Github #121, Gitlab #2411)

2027.	[func]		fdupont
	The TLS is now supported with Multi-Threaded HA (HA+MT) scenario.
	Additional parameters (trust-anchor, cert-file, key-file,
	require-client-certs) are now supported in the HA configuration.
	(Gitlab #1706)

	The MySQL schema has been changed to provide initial support for
	the lease limiting feature, part of the limits hook library.
	(Gitlab #2438)

2025.	[bug]		tmark
	Added missing support for client-class user-context to
	both MySQL and PostgreSQL CB hook libraries.
	(Gitlab #2430)

2024.	[func]		djt
	The ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET log message format has been
	slightly modified, so that when it is emitted for a subnet that
	is not within a shared network, it emits "(none)" for the value
	of the shared network. The ARM documentation for this parameter
	has been updated to reflect that subnets within shared networks
	will in fact display which shared network the subnet belongs to.
	The ALLOC_ENGINE_V6_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET log message format has
	changed to be consistent with the format of
	ALLOC_ENGINE_V4_ALLOC_FAIL_SUBNET.
	(Gitlab #2395)

2023.	[bug]		tmark
	Corrected a MySQL CB issue that caused subnets to be
	updated without having audit entries created when the
	affiliated shared-network is deleted.  This can cause
	the subnets to be excluded from subsequent CB refresh
	cycles.
	(Gitlab #2299)

Kea 2.1.6 (development) released on May 25 2022

2022.	[func]		andrei, djt
	kea-admin lease-upload now calls the lease file cleanup (LFC)
	process to clean up entries with duplicate addresses in the input
	CSV file, to avoid a conflict error when inserting the leases in
	the database. kea-admin also no longer asks for input on
	non-interactive shells. A new -y|--yes flag has been added that
	enables automatic overwriting of any file that kea-admin writes
	to, when dumping or uploading leases.
	(Gitlab #2293)

2021.	[build]		razvan
	The library version numbers have been bumped for the Kea 2.1.6
	development release.
	(Gitlab #2421)

2020.	[doc]		andrei
	The rate-limiting feature of the new limits hook library has been
	documented. It can apply a specified limit of a certain number of
	packets per time unit to a given client class or subnet.
	(Gitlab #562, #1650)

2019.	[func]		tmark
	A new built-in class, "SKIP_DDNS", was added, which can be used
	in conjunction with the ddns-tuning hook library to skip
	performing DDNS updates for a given client.
	(Gitlab #2354)

2018.	[func]		razvan
	The kea-dhcp4 server now supports portions of RFC 3396, allowing
	it to send and receive DHCP options longer than 255 bytes.
	(Gitlab #2227)

2017.	[bug]		marcin
	A bug in the allocation engine, which caused it to write an
	allocated lease under the wrong subnet ID within a shared
	network, has been corrected. This was occurring when multiple
	clients matched the same fixed address reservation. The first

	client is then given a dynamically allocated address from a
	different subnet in the shared network.
	(Gitlab #2409)

2016.	[doc]		fdupont
	Documentation for the role-based access control (RBAC)
	premium hook library was added to the ARM.

Kea 2.1.5 (development) released on Apr 27, 2022

2015.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed an issue in kea-dhcp6 that was causing the server
	not to update the FQDN option in outbound responses when
	the ddns-tuning hook lib calculates a new host name.
	(Gitlab #2392)

2014.	[bug]		tmark
	Correct an issue that was causing reconfigure to fail
	in kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 when using ddns-tuning hook
	library.
	(Gitlab #2390)

2013.	[build]		razvan

	Documented whether it's OK or not to have overlapping pools,
	including PD pools in IPv6.
	(Gitlab #1842)

2011.	[func]		djt
	Added CTRL_AGENT_COMMAND_RECEIVED log line with command and
	source address to the kea-ctrl-agent for commands which

	it is available.
	(Gitlab #687)

2010.	[func]		razvan
	Several extra log messages now detail the subnet selection
	process. The messages are available on debuglevel 40.
	(Gitlab #2352)

2009.	[func]		tmark
	Added new hook callout points: ddns4_update to Kea DHCPv4
	server and ddns6_update to Kea DHCPv6 server. This enables
	use of the ddns-tuning hook library.
	(Gitlab #1548)

2008.	[func]*		tomek
	The support for benchmarks have been removed.
	(Gitlab #2372)

2007.	[func]		tmark
	Added split() function to classification expression
	language.
	(GitLab #2272)

2006.	[func]		slawek
	Added ``service-sockets-require-all`` parameter to specify
	mandatory successfully binding all needed service sockets to
	initialize DHCP services (defaults to false). If any socket is
	unavailable, then the service fails to start. Added
	``service-sockets-max-retries`` parameter (defaults to 0) to
	specify the number of retries to open unavailable sockets and
	``service-sockets-retry-wait-time`` parameter to specify a time

Kea 2.1.4 (development) released on March 30, 2022

2004.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.4 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2363)

2003.	[func]		fdupont
	Added the support of sub-options in the flex_option
	hook library.
	(GitLab #2314)

2002.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed a bug in MySql config backend that caused it to
	store unspecified, client-class valid and preferred life
	time values as zero in the database.
	(Gitlab #2344)

2001.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a bug which causes client classes with empty test
	expressions to fail class evaluation when those classes are
	retrieved from config backend.
	(Gitlab #2336)

2000.	[func]		fdupont
	Added the ``early-global-reservations-lookup`` configuration
	parameter which allows to perform a search for global host
	reservations and set client classes before the subnet
	selection. This is achieved when explicitly configured to
	``true`` and it defaults to ``false`` if not configured.
	(Gitlab #2249)

1999.	[func]		tmark, razvan
	The kea-dhcp6 server fully supports using PostgreSQL for config
	backend. This should be considered an experimental feature.
	(Gitlab #2355, #2356)

1998.	[func]		tmark, razvan
	With the addition of support for client classes, the kea-dhcp4
	server now fully supports using PostgreSQL for config backend.
	(Gitlab #2322)

1997.	[bug]		tmark
	The obsolete log message, DHCP4_NCR_CREATE, has been
	removed from kea-dhcp4.
	(GitLab #2301)

Kea 2.1.3 (development) released on Feb 23, 2022

1996.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.3 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2317)

1995.	[func]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now supports using PostgreSQL for config
	backend for everything except client classes. The
	new hook library is libdhcp_pgsql_cb.so. This should
	be considered an experimental feature.
	(Gitlab #95)

1994.	[func]		razvan
	Added support for Server Identifier Override RAI sub-option
	(RFC 5107). The implementation is not complete according to the
	RFC, because the server does not store the RAI, but the
	functionality handles expected use cases.
	(Gitlab #1695)

1993.	[func]		razvan
	Added global and per subnet counters for allocation failures:
	``v4-allocation-fail``, ``v4-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``v4-allocation-fail-subnet``, ``v4-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``v4-allocation-fail-classes``, ``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-subnet``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``subnet[X].v4-allocation-fail-classes``,
	``v6-allocation-fail``, ``v6-allocation-fail-shared-network``,
	``v6-allocation-fail-subnet``, ``v6-allocation-fail-no-pools``,

	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-subnet``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-no-pools``,
	``subnet[X].v6-allocation-fail-classes``.
	There is a warning log message emitted in the logs each time one
	of the allocation failure counters is incremented.
	(Gitlab #2054)

1992.	[bug]		razvan
	The ``maxver`` and ``maxsize`` logger parameters are excluded
	from ``config-get`` command response if the logger output is
	``stdout``, ``stderr`` or ``syslog``.
	(Gitlab #2288)

1991.	[bug]		jinmei, razvan
	Fixed keactrl exit code when netconf is not build.
	(Gitlab #2262)

1990.	[func]		razvan
	Added the ``reservations-lookup-first`` configuration parameter
	which controls whether host reservations lookup should be
	performed before lease lookup. This parameter has effect only
	when multi-threading is disabled. When multi-threading is
	enabled, host reservations lookup is always performed first. The
	``reservations-lookup-first`` parameter defaults to ``false``
	when multi-threading is disabled.
	(Gitlab #2036)

Kea 2.1.2 (development) released on Jan 26, 2022

1989.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.2 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2281)

1988.	[bug]		tmark
	Kea core logic now ensures options belonging
	to client classes are properly created when
	classes are read from configuration backends.
	(Gitlab #2246)

1987.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed an issue in PostgreSQL support code that caused
	asserts when compiled with: -Wp,-D_GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS.
	(Gitlab #2284)

1986.	[func]		fdupont
	The kea-admin command now accepts extra arguments which
	are passed to the database command tool, e.g. '--ssl' to
	'mysql' with `kea-admin ... -x --ssl'. Quotes are not
	preserved but multiple arguments can be given.
	(Gitlab #2225)

1985.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support for using files to configure basic HTTP
	credentials. Instead of configuring a value, it is taken from
	the content of a file. The new parameters of the Control Agent
	configuration are:
	- 'user-file' pointing to a file vs 'user'
	- 'password-file' pointing to a file vs 'password'
	- 'password-file' pointing to a file with the secret
	(which is <user>:<password>) vs 'user' and 'password'.
	For the High Availability hook library the new parameter
	is 'basic-auth-password-file' which can be used as an
	alternative to 'basic-auth-password'.
	(Gitlab #2006)

1984.	[func]		andrei
	Introduced the lease-upload command to kea-admin which can upload
	leases from a memfile CSV file to a database backend.
	(Gitlab #2039)

1983.	[bug]		fdupont
	Minimum and maximum values of lifetimes are no longer
	skipped when the configuration is retrieved even when
	they are the same as the default value.
	(Gitlab #2222)

1982.	[bug]		andrei
	The config for an HA peer now accepts an IPv6 address as a valid
	value for the "url" entry.
	(Gitlab #2264)

1981.	[func]		tomek
	The default-url DHCPv4 option has been replaced with
	v4-captive-portal, as defined in RFC8910.
	(Gitlab #1684)

1980.	[func]*		andrei
	The kea-admin lease-dump command now outputs a CSV file that is
	compatible with the memfile backend. This is useful when
	migrating from database to memfile. The generated output is
	backwards incompatible. Any tools that depend on it would need
	to adapt.
	(Gitlab #2038)

1979.	[bug]		fdupont
	Update and delete operations on leases no longer raise
	an error with infinite valid lifetime (used by BOOTP)
	and MySQL or PostgreSQL backends where timestamps can
	be limited to 32 bits.
	(Gitlab 897)

1978.	[doc]		tomek
	The Kea Administrator Reference Manual now correctly states that
	DHCPv6 authentication option has code 11, not 10.
	(Gitlab #2207)

1977.	[bug]		razvan
	Use only MAX_HWADDR_LEN (20) bytes from remote-id when extracting
	the MAC from relay options.
	(Gitlab #2201)

1976.	[func]		andrei
	Added hwtype and hwaddr_source columns to v6 memfile.
	(Gitlab #2236)

1975.	[func]		tmark
	Additional changes and corrections relating to Config Backend
	were made to the PostgreSQL database schema.  In addition, the
	upgrade scripts were renamed to ensure proper file name ordering.
	Note that PostgreSQL CB is not yet functional.
	(Gitlab #2183, #2244, #2245)

1974.	[func]		fdupont
	The global parameter lookup has been refactored to provide better
	performance. Proper return error code (CONTROL_RESULT_ERROR) has
	been fixed in some cases when trying to apply the new
	configuration. Old code was using wrong hardcoded '2' value
	(CONTROL_RESULT_COMMAND_UNSUPPORTED).
	(Gitlab #1082)

1973.	[func]		fdupont
	MySQL backends now can be configured to use the SSL/TLS
	support to protect connections to the server. New
	database parameters are "cert-file", "key-file",
	"trust-anchor" and "cipher-list". The negotiated cipher
	name is logged so the MySQL service configuration can
	be checked. PostgreSQL accepts the same parameters
	but they only trigger the call to the OpenSSL generic
	initialization in the Pq C-API.
	(Gitlab #34)

1972.	[func]		andrei
	Kea servers now can accept trailing commas in file
	configurations. While parsing, a warning is printed with the
	location of the comma to give the user the ability to correct
	a mistake.
	(Gitlab #2084)

1971.	[func]		tmark, jad
	Added support for embedded DHCPv6 DUIDs within DHCPv4
	Client Identifier options per RFC 4361.  This allows
	Kea to support DDNS in dual stack environments per
	RFC 4703(Sec 5.2). Thanks to John Dickinson for
	contributing the patch!
	(Gitlab #1934)

Kea 2.1.1 (development) released on Nov 24, 2021

	Fixed make check failing when googletest support was disabled.
	(Gitlab #2167)

1967.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed a bug where keactrl did not color the active status code
	for kea-dhcp-ddns as it did for the other servers.
	(Gitlab #2117)

1966.	[func]		djt
	Allow Kea to pack opaque data tuples within options with zero
	length to accommodate some DHCP clients who have been observed
	to send DHCPv4 option 124 with zero length tuples.
	(Gitlab #2021)

	Added support for Debian 11 in hammer.py.
	(Gitlab #2042, #2193)

1963.	[func]		andrei
	hammer.py has had several improvements.
	NETCONF and PostgreSQL will be properly configured when running
	prepare-system on Fedora and FreeBSD.
	vagrant will be automatically upgraded if it is too outdated.
	Error messages are more clear when running on unsupported
	systems.
	hammer.py is now able to detect Arch Linux distributions and
	offers limited support for it, being able to prepare-system with
	freeradius and netconf support.
	(Gitlab #2111, #2112)

1962.	[func]		andrei
	kea-netconf updates: fixed store-extended-info, it was an
	operational node instead of a config node. Added several
	containers and leaves: compatibility, lenient-option-parsing,
	multi-threading, enable-multi-threading, packet-queue-size,
	thread-pool-size, valid-lifetime, min-valid-lifetime,
	max-valid-lifetime, preferred-lifetime, min-preferred-lifetime,

	(Gitlab #2136)

1961.	[func]		tomek, tmark
	The initial, stubbed version of the PostgreSQL CB hook
	library has been created.  The library is not yet functional
	and does not installed.
	(Gitlab #1848)

1960.	[build]		andrei
	Froze sphinx dependency versions used to build documentation.
	Added the update-python-dependencies Makefile rule to bump the
	versions.
	(Gitlab #2161)

1959.	[doc]		djt
	Move documentation for acceptable format strings into the Kea
	ARM. The relevant section of the ARM was previously referring
	to a dead link in the Log4cpp documentation.
	(Gitlab #2134)

1958.	[func]		tomek, tmark
	PostgreSQL database schema has been extended with tables for
	Config Backend (CB). This is the first step towards PostgreSQL
	CB. However, as there is no code yet to use those new tables,
	they're not not functional yet.
	(Gitlab #90, #2166)

Kea 2.1.0 (development) released on Oct 27, 2021

1957.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.1.0 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2141)

1956.	[bug]		tmark
	Modified stat_cmds hook library to omit statistics
	for non-existent subnets from results returned by
	stat-lease4-get and stat-lease6-get commands.
	(Gitlab #2033)

1955.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 no longer sends DHCPNAKs in response to
	DHCPREQUESTs for addresses for which it has no knowledge.
	(Gitlab #1584)

1954.	[doc]		fdupont
	Updated the Developer's Guide to explain what to do when
	GSS-TSIG hook unit tests fail from a system Kerberos
	incompatible configuration.
	(Gitlab #2056)

1953.	[build]		fdupont
	Changed the name of the GSS-TSIG hook library object to
	libddns_gss_tsig.so.
	(Gitlab #2115)

Kea 2.0.0 (stable) released on September 29, 2021

1952.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 2.0.0 stable version.
	(Gitlab #2104)

1951.	[doc]		tomek
	A new appendix for configuration templates added to Kea ARM.
	the first of which is a home power user.
	(Gitlab #2050)

1950.	[doc]		slawek
	Added a description and an example of the usage of the "include"
	statement in the Kea configuration file to the ARM.
	(Gitalb #2080)

1949.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp6 now correctly determines DNS update flags when
	the allocation engine dynamically changes the selected
	network subnet.
	(Gitlab #1622)

1948.	[func]		tmark
	HTTP library will now emit a warning log when the queue of
	pending client requests for a given URL exceeds a threshold.
	(Gitlab #2085)

1947.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in the High Availability hooks library that could
	cause a standby server not to synchronize its lease database
	after a temporary communication interruption with its partner.
	(Gitlab #1959)

1946.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixes a bug in MySQL configuration backend schema. DHCP options
	associated with deleted client classes are now automatically
	deleted.
	(Gitlab #2094)

1945.	[build]		andrei
	Reverted qa#261 changes, which forced linking with OpenSSL 1.1
	when available. This caused a segfault, when Kea's crypto library
	used OpenSSL 1.1, but the MySQL library it linked against, used
	OpenSSL 1.0.
	(Gitlab #2081)

1944.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 both now support a global parameter,
	parked-packet-limit, that can be used to limit the number
	of client responses the server may park pending completion
	of hook library callouts.
	(Gitlab #1307)

1943.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in fetching client classes from the Config Backend.
	The bug resulted in failures during attempts to evaluate the
	classes for a received packet.
	(Gitlab #2077)

1942.	[func]		fdupont
	Added basic statistics to the DHCP-DDNS server.
	(Gitlab #2040)

1941.	[func]		fdupont
	Per DNS server TSIG keys are now supported in the DHCP-DDNS
	(aka D2) server configuration. A new callout point 'select_key'
	gives access to the selected TSIG key before sending DNS updates.
	(Gitlab #2011)

Kea 1.9.11 (development) released on Aug 30, 2021

1940.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.11 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #2053)

1939.	[bug]		tmark
	Removed all MultiThreadingCriticalSections from lease_cmds
	hooks library which can cause a dead-lock when running HA+MT.
	The commands simply try to acquire the resource lock and fail
	if the resource is unavailable also logging an error message.
	(Gitlab #2051)

1938.	[bug]		razvan
	Fix dead locks caused by commands with CS on http listener
	threads and CS on main thread racing with CS on other threads.
	(Gitlab #2041, #2043)

1937.	[bug]		razvan
	The Config Backend is now capable of reestablishing database
	connection after a failure.
	(Gitlab #1982)

1936.	[build]		andrei
	Kea attempts to first link with compatibility library OpenSSL 1.1
	(usually found on CentOS 7) before falling back to the system
	OpenSSL (1.0 on CentOS 7 which is out of support).
	(Gitlab qa#261)

1935.	[func]		andrei
	The store-extended-info config entry was added to Kea YANG
	modules at root-level and at subnet-level.
	(Gitlab #1944)

1934.	[func]		tmark
	Kea-dhcp6 now supports specifying valid-lifetime and
	preferred-lifetime values in client classes (via both
	configuration file and Config Backend).  Prior to this
	it could only be specified at the global, shared-network,
	and subnet scopes.
	(Gitlab #1710)

1933.	[doc]		fdupont, tomek
	Added a new ARM section about GSS-TSIG. Currently it describes
	how to build Kea with GSS-API support. It will be expanded in
	the future.
	(Gitlab #2018)

1932.	[func]		tmark
	MySQL indexing of leases database has been improved. It now
	behaves better on older MySQL versions. In particular, the lease
	reclamation no longer causes full scans to be performed. This
	fix introduces MySQL schema update to 11.0. This should reduce
	the periodic performance slowdowns.
	(Gitlab #2030)

1931.	[bug]		tomek
	Two hook messages HOOKS_CALLOUT_ERROR and HOOKS_CALLOUT_MESSAGES
	are now printing the hook name and index properly. Thank you to
	Shawn Routhier for reporting the issue.
	(Gitlab #2020)

	Thanks to Brad Smith for the patch!
	(Gitlab #1980)

1928.	[bug]		tmark
	Modified kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 to only append the
	ddns-qualifying-suffix if the input name does not
	already end with that suffix.  Prior to this the
	suffix was always added which could lead to names
	including the suffix twice.
	(Gitlab #1529)

Kea 1.9.10 (development) released on Jul 30, 2021

1927.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.10 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1984)

1926.	[func]*		marcin
	Server tags in the MySQL database are now represented as strings
	with a maximum length of 64 characters. Previously, the server
	tags could be up to 256 characters long, and it could cause
	database migrations to fail on the systems with UTF-8 encoding
	configured for MySQL. Shorter server tags avoid hitting the
	limitation on the maximum length of an indexed table column.
	(Gitlab #1976)

1925.	[build]		fdupont
	Updated parsers to bison 3.3 or later.
	(Gitlab #453)

1924.	[bug]		razvan
	The MultiThreadingCriticalSection is now thread-safe and can be
	called from http client or http listener processing threads.
	(Gitlab #1964)

1923.	[func]		andrei
	Integrate with Sysrepo v1.x branch. Building with support for
	Sysrepo now requires the latest v1.x versions:
	sysrepo v1.4.140 + libyang v1.0.240.
	Support for legacy Sysrepo versions v0.x has been dropped.
	(Gitlab #1077)

1922.	[func]		marcin
	Added support for storing client classes in the MySQL config
	backend.
	(Gitlab #1920, #1928, #1965, #1972, #1977)

1921.	[func]		fdupont
	The D2 d2_srv_configured hook point used DROP status to notify
	the D2 server that an error has occurred and the configuration
	is rejected. The error message is passed to the D2 server
	through the new 'error' hook parameter.
	(Gitlab #1950)

Kea 1.9.9 (development) released on June 30, 2021

	Bump library versions for the Kea 1.9.9 development release.
	(Gitlab #1947)

1919.	[bug]		razvan
	Fix the run script hook library leaving behind defunct processes.
	(Gitlab #1878)

1918.	[bug]		razvan
	When parsed, PSID was incorrectly ignoring the PSID value when
	psid-len was 16 instead of ignoring it when the values is 0 as
	per the RFC.
	(Gitlab #1858)

1917.	[func]		tomek
	DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 are now more consistent when logging the
	reasons	why a packet was dropped. This information is now
	available on debuglevel 15. Also added a section in the ARM
	discussing the debug levels. The subnet selection failed log
	message now provides more useful information about the subnet.
	(Gitlab #1915, #1916)

1916.	[func]		razvan
	The Kea DHCPv4 server accepts requests using server identifier
	configured at client class level.
	(Gitlab #1836)

1915.	[func]		andrei
	DOCSIS options are no longer offered to any vendor other than
	Cable Labs (vendor-id == 4491). This was not an explicit check
	previously and the match to the vendor relied on a technicality
	such that other vendors could have received these options under
	certain conditions.
	(Gitlab #1894)

1914.	[func]*		tomek
	The Cassandra (CQL) support is being deprecated, both for
	leases and host backends. For the time being the features
	will produce a warning, but will otherwise function normally.
	However, the functionality will be removed in the future
	Kea releases.
	(Gitlab #1892)

1913.	[doc]		tomek
	Kea adopted Developer Certificate of Origin for incoming
	contributions. Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for details.
	(Gitlab #1895)

1912.	[doc]		fdupont, tomek
	The Kea configuration syntax is now documented in BNF notation.
	See new appendix in the ARM.
	(Gitlab #504, #745)

1911.	[bug]		andrei
	Fixed a minor regression where kea-admin and keactrl would output
	technical errors like "unbound variable" instead of more helpful
	messages like "missing backend" because of the undefined variable
	checks introduced in 1.9.4. Added tests to further prevent it.
	(Gitlab #1653)

1910.	[func]		andrei
	Extended perfdhcp to send v4 DHCPRELEASE messages via -F flag.
	(Gitlab #1119)

1909.	[build]		fdupont
	Experimental support for Heimdal implementation of GSS-API
	with Kerberos 5 added.
	(Gitlab #1909)

1908.	[func]		razvan
	Added export for V4 option 82 (DHO_DHCP_AGENT_OPTIONS) and
	respective suboptions 1 (RAI_OPTION_AGENT_CIRCUIT_ID) and
	suboption 2 (RAI_OPTION_REMOTE_ID) in the run script hooks
	library.
	(Gitlab #1840)

1907.	[doc]		peterd, andrei, razvan
	Many Kea ARM corrections and updates.
	(Gitlab #1917)

1906.	[func]		fdupont
	Added support for the TKEY DNS resource record.
	(Gitlab #1880)

1905.	[build]		fdupont
	Added an optional --with-gssapi switch to the configure
	script. It checks for the presence and suitability of
	packages pertinent to GSS-TSIG. This has been added in
	anticipation of future work and does not add any
	functionality to Kea.
	(Gitlab #1884)

Kea 1.9.8 (development) released on May 26, 2021

1904.	[build]		wlodek
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.8 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1882)

1903.	[func]		andrei
	Kea now recognizes requests sent from vendors that include their
	information in DHCPv6 Vendor Class option (code 16) for the
	purpose of offering custom options in the response. Previously,
	only the Vendor-specific Information option (code 17) was
	searched for a vendor ID. For the purpose of classification, both
	options are looked into, now, just as before.
	(Gitlab #1837)

1902.	[func]		andrei, fdupont
	All logs that expose configuration, either in full or in snippets
	now have the values of "password" and "secret" entries replaced
	with asterisks "*****".
	(Gitlab #1721)

1901.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in DHCPv4 subnet selection. The server ignored
	the Subnet Selection option supplied by a client if its query
	contained a Relay Agent Information (RAI) option without a Link
	Selection option. After this change, the server respects the
	Subnet Selection option when RAI lacks the Link Selection
	option. If RAI includes it, it takes precedence over the Subnet
	Selection option.
	(Gitlab #1816)

1900.	[bug]		tmark
	Fixed a sporadic failure caused by a wrong assertion in
	unit test, testMtHttpClientTest.workPauseResumeShutdown,
	introduced by #1818.
	(Gitlab #1876)

1899.	[func]		tmark,razvan
	In HA+Mt mode, the HA hook library now pauses and resumes
	its worker threads when Kea core enters and exits critical
	sections, respectively.  This eliminates race conditions
	during core processing such as reconfiguration, shutdown,
	and certain RESTful API commands.
	(Gitlab #1818)

1898.	[func]		fdupont
	The DROP class may now depend on the KNOWN or UNKNOWN classes
	and may be used after the host reservation lookup.
	(Gitlab #1815)

1897.	[func]		andrei
	Kea has a new configuration section called "compatibility" geared
	towards non-compliant clients. The only boolean parameter added
	for now called "lenient-option-parsing" changes the way DHCPv6
	option 16's vendor-class-data field is parsed. When enabled,
	instead of complaining that a length exceeds the rest of the
	option's buffer, the value is considered to be the rest of the
	buffer. This also applies to custom options defined with the
	tuple type for both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6.
	(Gitlab #1860)

1896.	[func]		wlodek
	Perfdhcp extended to send v6 traffic from multiple networks.
	(Gitlab #1416)

1895.	[func]		razvan
	Added additional evaluation tokens to extract and print data:
	addrtotext, int8totext, int16totext, int32totext, uint8totext,
	uint16totext, uint32totext.
	(Gitlab #1680)

1894.	[func]		fdupont
	Implemented 'auth' logger, dedicated to logging access
	control information, such as basic HTTP authentication.
	(Gitlab #1590)

1893.	[func]		fdupont
	Botan 2.14 or later can now be used as a crypto library for
	the TLS/HTTPS support in Kea.
	(Gitlab #1665)

1892.	[func]		fdupont
	Added + operator as an convenient alias to concat() function
	in expressions.
	(Gitlab #1824)

Kea 1.9.7 (development) released on Apr 28, 2021

1891.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.7 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1820)

1890.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added a new section to the ARM, Kea Security, which describes
	various security related topics and how to address them.
	(Gitlab #1587)

1889.	[func]		fdupont
	Accept comments (shell '#', C++ '//' and C '/*...*/') in
	JSON commands sent via the control channel or the Control
	Agent.
	(Gitlab #1652)

1888.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new operational mode, HA+MT, to the HA hook library.
	HA+MT provides direct, multi-threaded HTTP communication
	between peers for the exchange HA protocol commands and
	responses.
	(Gitlab #1736)

1887.	[build]		andrei, fdupont
	Migrated autoconf macros, which became warningly deprecated
	since autoconf 2.70, to supported macros.
	(Gitlab #1632, #1651)

1886.	[doc]		tomek
	Added a section in the ARM explaining the relationship between
	keactrl and systemd scripts.
	(Gitlab #1759)

1885.	[func]		andrei
	kea-admin is now able to interactively ask for a password if no
	parameter follows the -p or the --password parameters. This
	requires the user to give it as the last parameter. The entered
	password is not echoed back to the terminal in order to prevent
	over-the-shoulder snooping or other social engineering
	techniques. Alternatively, you can set the password via the
	KEA_ADMIN_DB_PASSWORD environment variable.
	(Gitlab #1675)

1884.	[doc]		fdupont
	HTTP_CONNECTION_HANDSHAKE_FAILED log message got a
	description.
	(Gitlab #1779)

Kea 1.9.6 (development) released on March 31, 2021

1883.	[build]		andrei
	Bump library versions for Kea 1.9.6 release.
	(Gitlab #1772)

1882.	[func]		razvan
	Implemented database connection recovery for forensic logging.
	To achieve this, the "on-fail" connection parameter has been
	added to control the action performed on connection loss.
	The supported values are "stop-retry-exit", "serve-retry-exit"
	and "serve-retry-continue". They indicate if the server should
	disable the service on connection loss ("stop-retry-exit") or if
	on recovery failure the server should shut down
	("stop-retry-exit" and "serve-retry-exit") or continue
	("serve-retry-continue"). The default value used (if not
	configured) is "stop-retry-exit" for lease, host and config
	backends, and "serve-retry-continue" for forensic log.
	(Gitlab #1621)

1881.	[func]		fdupont
	Moved errors about URLs using names (vs addresses) or
	https (vs http) scheme in High Availability hook
	configuration from connection opening time to
	configuration time.
	(Gitlab #1758)

1880.	[build]		fdupont
	TLS support is now reported by configure in the
	cryptographic backend section.
	(Gitlab #1774)

1879.	[func]		fdupont
	The Control Agent now supports TLS/HTTPS. This works with
	OpenSSL and there are known problems with Botan, which will
	be addressed in the future.
	(Gitlab #1662)

1878.	[bug]		razvan
	Request enabling DHCP service when the HA hooks library is
	unloaded. It may remain disabled if it had been disabled
	outside of the HA hooks library. Prior to this change, if
	the HA hooks library disabled the DHCP service it would
	always remain disabled after the hooks library was unloaded.
	(Gitlab #1697)

1877.	[func]		fdupont
	kea-shell supports TLS/HTTPS. This is limited to the python 3
	version i.e. if kea-shell is configured with python 2 it still
	works in 1.9.6 but raises an error if a new TLS/HTTPS argument
	is specified.
	(Gitlab #1663)

1876.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added documentation for TLS/HTTPS support.
	(Gitlab #1664)

1875.	[func]		fdupont
	TLS/HTTPS support was added to asiolink and http libraries.
	(Gitlab #1661)

1874.	[doc]		marcin
	Added notes in the ARM highlighting that the address and
	delegated prefix pools must be split when HA load-balancing
	mode is used.
	(Gitlab #1726)

1873.	[func]		andrei
	kea-admin now accepts the -P|--port parameter with a custom
	port used to connect to the database.
	(Gitlab #1674)

Kea 1.9.5 (development) released on Feb 24, 2021

1872.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.5 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1713)

1871.	[bug]		andrei
	The cache threshold feature introduced in 1.9.4 modified
	previously versioned schema 9.5. This caused problems for people
	who had already upgraded to 9.5 which in Kea versions means 1.9.2
	and 1.9.3.
	In this change, the upgrade commands were moved to schema 9.6 and
	are only applied if the database does not contain the required
	columns. Affected Kea installments can now be upgraded to 1.9.5
	and above seamlessly.
	(Gitlab #1698)

1870.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed a crash when using the Kea Legal Log Hooks Library with
	multi-threading. This bug was affecting only database backends.
	The log file backend was not affected by this bug.
	(Gitlab #1711)

1869.	[func]		tmark
	Kea-dhcp4 now supports specifying valid-lifetime in client
	classes.  Prior to this it could only be specified at the
	global, shared-network, and subnet scopes.
	(Gitlab #1635)

1868.	[func]		andrei
	The forensic log hook library has gained an auto-increment
	primary key column in it's logs table. It is now able to function
	in a MySQL Percona cluster which requires a primary key for all
	it's tables when configured with pxc_strict_mode = ENFORCING
	which is also the default value.
	(Gitlab #1709)

1867.	[bug]		andrei
	MySQL connection unit tests have been modified to work with
	Percona cluster. This change doesn't fix all problems, but it
	improves the situation sufficiently to be able to run unit tests
	with positive results on a Percona cluster.
	(Gitlab #1708)

1866.	[func]		marcin
	Added new log messages issued when a dynamic lease allocation
	fails. The new messages provide comprehensive information about
	the circumstances in which the failure occurred. In particular,
	they state whether the client is connected to a shared network
	or not. If it is, the shared network name is provided. Otherwise,
	the client's subnet id is logged. The new messages also inform
	from how many subnets the server attempted to allocate a lease
	and how many subnets could not be used because of non-matching
	client classes.
	(Gitlab #1701)

1865.	[func]		razvan
	Implemented the Run Script hooks library which can be used to
	run external scripts for specific packet processing hook points.
	There are several exported environment variables available for
	the script. Currently the implementation is nonblocking and
	Kea will not wait for the script to finish execution before
	continuing to the next step. For this reason, the next step
	provided by the script is ignored.
	(Gitlab #899)

1864.	[func]		fdupont
	New parameters to handle TLS support added in Control Agent
	config: "trust-anchor", "cert-file", "key-file" and
	"cert-required". They can be configured, but their values are
	not yet used.
	(Gitlab #1662)

1863.	[func]		andrei
	The perfdhcp tool now supports the -x l option that exports the
	assigned leases to stdout in CSV format. This new capability is
	very useful for the ongoing DB cluster experiments, where we need
	to correlate leases between multiple Kea instances sharing the
	same cluster.
	(Gitlab #1703)

1862.	[build]		andrei
	Added execution permissions to the upgrade scripts in Kea's
	installation. Previously kea-admin db-upgrade would fail with a
	permission denied error. It started manifesting in 1.9.3 and
	affected 1.9.4 as well. Additionally, now, when running make in
	the source repository to recreate scripts e.g. kea-admin, after a
	change to the .in files e.g. kea-admin.in, they maintain the
	execution permissions granted in the initial build. This makes
	development more seamless.
	(Gitlab #1681)

1861.	[bug]*		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now uses the value for each fixed field (e.g.
	next-server, server-hostname, boot-file-name) from the
	first class in query's list of classes that specifies the
	field. Prior to this it used the value from the last class
	which specified the field. It may be necessary to revise
	existing configurations to get the desired values.
	(Gitlab #1672)

Kea 1.9.4 (development) released on Jan 27, 2021

1860.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.4 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1666)

1859.	[doc]		wlodek
	Added example files with configured Vendor Specific Information
	option (code 43) and Vendor-Identifying Vendor-specific
	Information option (code 125) with several suboptions each.
	(Gitlab #1546)

1858.	[bug]		razvan
	The DHCP service can be independently enabled or disabled by
	the user command, by the database connection mechanics or
	by the HA library. The DHCP service is disabled when any
	of those originators disables the service, and it is enabled
	when all those who previously disabled the service enable it.
	The 'dhcp-enable' and 'dhcp-disable' commands accept 'origin'
	parameter with valid values of 'user' (which is the default)
	indicating a user generated command and 'ha-partner' which is
	used internally by the HA library.
	(Gitlab #1601)

1857.	[build]		andrei
	Code format styles meant to be as close as possible to the
	recommended coding guidelines are now included with the Kea
	source repository in the form of .clang-format and
	.uncrustify.cfg. The clang-format.sh and uncrustify.sh scripts in
	the tools directory can be used to apply these styles to chosen
	files. See coding guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
	(Gitlab #1455)

1856.	[bug]		razvan
	When using the config backend, the server converts the old
	'reservation-mode' global parameter internally to new
	reservation flags. The new flags are listed when issuing the
	config-get command.
	(Gitlab #1598)

1855.	[func]		marcin
	Improved failover procedure in Kea High Availability library
	by introducing new communication-recovery state. In this
	state the load balancing servers remain responsive to DHCP
	queries when the communication between them is interrupted.
	The new feature is controlled using the delayed-updates-limit
	configuration parameter.
	(Gitlab #1402)

1854.	[func, perf]	fdupont
	Implemented "lease caching", a feature similar to ISC
	DHCP's dhcp-cache-threshold. Lease caching is configured
	through two new parameters: cache-max-age and cache-threshold,
	and is supported by both kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6. When enabled,
	lease-caching allows the server to skip updating lease storage,
	when a client is requesting it's own pre-existing lease whose
	age falls under the cache threshold and for which there are no
	substantive changes to lease values such as the hostname.
	(Gitlab #1418)

1853.	[func]		fdupont
	Populated the space field of option definitions. This solved
	reported bugs where a specific standard option processing
	was applied to an option from another space but sharing the
	same code. In particular, this fixes the problem reported
	with vendor suboption 125.
	(Gitlab #1585)

1852.	[bug]		razvan
	Corrected the value of unacked-clients-left returned in response
	to the status-get command and the corresponding log messages.
	The previously returned value was too low by 1.
	(Gitlab #1578)

1851.	[func]		fdupont
	Removed methods fetching leases by both client identifier
	and hardware addresses from the API.
	(Gitlab #1540)

1850.	[build]		andrei
	Add two scripts to help with code aesthetics, insight on how Kea
	is built or minor build optimizations:
	* ./tools/check-for-duplicate-includes.sh: warns you if
	there is a source file that includes the same header twice.
	While this wouldn't normally result in any errors, it is an
	unusual practice. If you feel that a header should be included
	twice in a file, add the file under "# Exceptions:" in the
	script.
	* ./tools/print-generated-files.sh: prints all the files
	that are generated which may or may not be part of the
	repository. These consist of messages, parser files, and "built
	sources" (as called in Makefile.am files).
	(Gitlab #1602)

1849.	[doc]		tomek
	Two known DHCPv4 RFC violations are now documented in the ARM.
	They are both cases where Kea deliberately deviates from the
	RFC to accommodate some common broken-client behaviors.
	(Gitlab #1608, #1615)

1848.	[bug]		razvan
	The cql upgrade script from schema v3.0 to v4.0 was broken in
	Kea-1.9.3 and has been fixed also enabling the unittest.
	(Gitlab #1616)

Kea 1.9.3 (development) released on Dec 16, 2020

1847.	[bug]		andrei
	Harden shell scripts and fix some of the resulted test failures.
	* #!/bin/sh for all scripts
	* set -eu in all scripts
	* shellcheck all scripts, and fix all shellcheck warnings
	* and more...
	(Gitlab #1574)

1846.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.3 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1605)

1845.	[func]		marcin
	Kea configuration now allows for using database passwords
	which include whitespace.
	(Gitlab #692)

1844.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected a bug in Kea Control Agent error responses when a
	malformed command was sent. In some cases a map with an error
	response was returned instead of a list.
	(Gitlab #432)

1843.	[func]		andrei
	Allow perfdhcp to request options via option 55 PRL. perfdhcp
	adds option 55 with a few requested options by default so in
	order to allow `perfdhcp -o 55,abcd` special logic to merge all
	the buffers of option 55 was implemented. Works with multiple
	`-o` arguments.
	(Gitlab #1508)

1842.	[func]		razvan
	Fixed the db connection reconnect implementation to honor
	each connection backend configuration. The most important
	improvement is that only the affected manager will be
	recreated when a connection is lost. Previously, even
	managers which were not affected had to be recreated on
	any connection loss. Also fixed an issue with recovery
	when multi-threading is enabled.
	(Gitlab #1375)

1841.	[bug]		marcin
	Corrected issues with inheritance of the DHCPv6 interface-id
	parameter. When interface-id is set at shared network level
	but not at the subnet level this setting is properly propagated
	to the config backend and reported when responding to the
	config-get command. Prior to this change, if the interface-id
	was set for a shared network, it was always returned for the
	subnets belonging to this shared network, even when subnet
	specific value was not specified.
	(Gitlab #652)

1840.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed the inheritance of the triple min-valid-lifetime,
	valid-lifetime and max-valid-lifetime parameters from
	the global scope, and fixed it for preferred-lifetime too.
	Added a sanity check refusing incorrect settings, e.g.
	the lifetime not being between min and max values.
	(Gitlab #1456)

1839.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 now calculate the DDNS TTL value
	based on RFC 4702, Section 5 which suggests that the
	TTL value be 1/3 of the lease's valid life time with a
	minimum value of 10 minutes. Prior to this the servers
	set the TTL to equal to the lease's valid life time.
	(Gitlab #936)

1838.	[bug]		fdupont
	The DHCPv6 sent multiple instances of an option or a
	sub-option when it seems to be requested more than once
	directly by the client or using the always-send flag.
	(Gitlab #1449)

1837.	[doc]		cstrotm
	Several Kea ARM corrections.
	(Gitlab #1514)

Kea 1.9.2 (development) released on Nov 25, 2020

1836.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.2 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1555)

1835.	[doc]		peterd
	Several Kea ARM corrections.
	(Gitlab #1536)

1834.	[func]		fdupont
	Added two new callouts (hook points) in the control agent.
	The "auth" callout is executed after the basic authentication
	(if configured) and the command processing. The "response"
	callout is executed after the command processing and before
	the HTTP response is returned.
	(Gitlab #1421)

1833.	[doc]		sgoldlust
	Many documentation corrections.
	(Gitlab #1539)

1832.	[func]		tomek, wlodek
	Perfdhcp extended with functionality to gradually
	increase elapsed time in solicit and secs field in offer.
	(Gitlab #1332)

1831.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed the DHCPv6 server implementation of the
	reservations-out-of-pool flag to match the DHCPv4 one. When the
	flag is true:
	* the server assumes that all reserved address do not belong to
	  the dynamic pool.
	* the server will not assign reserved addresses that are inside
	  the dynamic pool to the respective clients.
	* addresses matching the respective reservations from inside
	  the dynamic pools (if any) can be dynamically assigned to any
	  client.
	(Gitlab #1550)

1830.	[func]		fdupont, razvan
	Added new configuration options reservations-global,
	reservations-in-subnet and reservations-out-of-pool to replace
	the old reservation-mode parameter. The new flags can be
	configured independently, adding support for new configuration
	scenarios when global and in subnet reservations are both
	active.
	(Gitlab #1405)

1829.	[bug]		fdupont, razvan
	Fixed a bug in the hasAddressReservation function which was
	causing the search for reservations to end as soon as no global
	reservation was found when configuring a subnet or shared
	network with global reservations enabled.
	(Gitlab #1405)

1828.	[bug]		andrei, razvan
	Fix trivial logic error in handling the "lease4-update" command
	manifesting itself on v4 if multi-threading is enabled.
	Notable affected environment is a HA with the
	"send-lease-updates" configuration setting explicitly set to
	true. Prior to this fix, lease updates would not go through to
	other HA nodes, even though some log lines would say they would.
	A simple workaround prior to this fix is to disable
	multi-threading.
	(Gitlab #1542)

1827.	[build]		andrei
	Add `tools/add-config-h.sh` script that can add
	`#include <config.h>` lines to non-generated source files that
	are missing it.
	(Gitlab #1453)

Kea 1.9.1 (development) released on Oct 28, 2020

1826.	[build]		razvan
	Library version numbers bumped for Kea 1.9.1 development
	version.
	(Gitlab #1481)

1825.	[doc]		andrei
	Examples for option definitions, option data, standardized option
	spaces other than "dhcp[46]", custom option spaces, option
	embedding under doc/examples/kea[46]/all-options.json.
	(Gitlab #1298)

1824.	[func]		tmark
	Added a new parameter, ddns-use-conflict-resolution, to
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6. This parameter is passed per request

	The forensic log hook library now logs release and decline
	events.
	(Gitlab #1445)

1820.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed lease update when using HA and lease_cmds hooks with
	database backend. Previously, HA updates were rejected because
	the database backend rejects operations on the lease if the old
	expiration time is different than what it is already stored, to
	act as a protection mechanism for parallel updates from several
	threads or processes.
	(Gitlab #1434)

1819.	[func]		fdupont
	Improved error messages for bad escapes in JSON strings.
	(Gitlab #151)

1818.	[doc]		andrei
	Add to the reservation documentation:
	* instructions on how to choose "reservation-mode"
	* priority of "reservation-mode" specified at all levels
	* priority of file reservations vs database reservations
	(Gitlab #1299)

1817.	[func]		fdupont
	Redact control agent logs to hide basic HTTP authentication
	passwords from the configuration files. Note that when HTTP
	headers are logged credentials are present in clear text.

	The message logged when basic HTTP authentication succeed is
	now informative (was DEBUG, is INFO now).
	(Gitlab #1450)

	Fixed libdhcpsrv build failures when building without database
	backends.
	(Gitlab #1468)

1814.	[func]		marcin
	Added ip-reservations-unique global parameter which controls
	whether or not it is allowed to create multiple host reservations
	for the same IP address or delegated prefix. By default, it is
	not allowed to create multiple reservations for the same lease
	within the same subnet. This change facilitates the use case
	in which a single host can communicate with the DHCP server over
	multiple network interfaces but should be assigned the same
	reserved lease regardless of which interface is used.
	(Gitlab #1428)

1813.	[func]		tmark
	A new parameter, ddns-update-on-renew, has been added to
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 configuration.  When true, the server
	will always update DNS when a lease is renewed even if the DNS
	information for the lease has not changed. The prior, and now
	default, behavior is for the server to only update DNS for a
	renewing lease if its DNS information has changed.

	Bump up libs version for Kea 1.9.0 release.
	(Gitlab #1400)

1809.	[func]		razvan
	Added csv-format option to flex_option hook to be able to insert
	option data in csv format. The implicit value is false,
	maintaining compatibility with the previous default raw format.
	(Gitlab #1373)

1808.	[func]		razvan
	Support for new IPv6-only-preferred option for DHCPv4 has been
	added. It lets Kea to signal to compatible devices that the
	IPv6 connectivity is available and they can disable their
	IPv4 stack. This implements support for draft-ietf-dhc-v6only-08,
	which is expected to be soon published by IETF as an RFC.
	(Gitlab #1351)

1807.	[doc]		tomek
	Added separate table with DHCPv4 options that are governed by Kea
	itself, rather than configured by administrator.
	(Gitlab #1323, #1398)

1806.	[bug]		tmark
	The DNS update code behaving better when there is a shared
	network and the code initially selected one subnet, but then
	later determined that a different subnet will be used. There
	is still a corner-case in DHCPv6 if the client requests multiple
	addresses or multiple prefixes and some of them is serviced from
	one subnet and some from another.

1803.	[doc]		fdupont
	Corrected Kea ARM sections describing how to send DHCPv6
	Vendor-specific Information Option (code 17) with sub-options.
	(Gitlab #1025)

1802.	[bug]		fdupont
	Removed the bug which allowed for repeating the same
	configuration parameter multiple times in the same scope.
	The second occurrence of the parameter overwrote the first
	occurrence causing server misconfiguration. Starting from
	this change an error is raised when the same parameter occurs
	multiple times in a given scope the location of the first value.

	(Gitlab #828)

1798.	[bug]		tmark
	kea-dhcp4 now correctly updates DNS when a client
	returns for lease after the lease has expired.  Prior
	to this, the server would remove the entries but then
	fail to add them unless the hostname (or FQDN) changed.
	This change also eliminates redundant DNS removes when
	expired leases are reclaimed and given to different clients.

Kea 1.8.0 (stable) released on Aug 26, 2020

1797.	[build]		razvan
	Bump up libs version for Kea 1.8.0 release.
	(Gitlab #1395)

1796.	[bug]		marcin
	Kea HTTP client re-establishes connection with the HTTP server
	when timeout occurs. Prior to this change the client tried to
	reuse the connection after timeout often getting subsequent
	timeouts. Re-establishing the connection may help avoid further
	timeouts during the High Availability operation.
	(Gitlab #1390)

1795.	[bug]		razvan

	how Kea servers respond to backend database connectivity issues.
	(Gitlab #1284)

1791.	[doc]		tmark
	Updated the ARM section for the Lease Commands hook library
	which incorrectly stated that a command return value of 2 would
	be returned when no lease(s) matched the command. The value
	returned is actually 3.
	(Gitlab #1384)

1790.	[bug]		marcin
	Fixed a bug in Kea Configuration Backend observed when using certain
	MariaDB	database versions. As a result of this bug the Kea servers were
	unable to fetch configurations stored in the database upon startup. The
	bug was related to the usage of timestamps which in MariaDB must be
	set to 1970-01-01 00:00:01 UTC or later. In some cases the Kea CB used
	out of bounds timestamp values. This bug was observed when using MariaDB
	10.4.13.

	(Gitlab #1254)

1787.	[bug]		razvan
	The recount leases functions consider leases in 'declined' state as
	'assigned' so that when the lease is reclaimed or reused, no negative
	counters are generated. The 'subnet[X].reclaimed-leases' and
	'reclaimed-leases' are now cumulative counters and are never
	decremented or reset until server restart. Removed references to non
	existent 'declined-reclaimed-addresses' counters.

	(Gitlab #1221)

1776.	[func]		fdupont
	DHCP servers now log a fatal error message when a reconfiguration
	attempt left a no longer working server. Documentation was
	updated tp propose remedy actions.
	(Gitlab #507,#1166)

1775.	[doc]		vicky
	A Code of Conduct has been added.
	(Gitlab #1143)

1774.	[func]		tmark
	leaseX-del commands now support a new parameter, update-ddns,
	which instructs the server to remove DNS entries for a
	lease after it has been deleted.
	(Gitlab #544)

1773.	[perf]		fdupont
	Kea statistics now uses standard c++11 chrono library instead
	of POSIX time library from boost.
	(Gitlab #1174)

1772.	[perf]		fdupont
	Set kea-lfc process priority to lower than default.
	This change should alleviate CPU utilization spikes caused
	by LFC process observed on some systems.
	(Gitlab #1311)

1771.	[func]		fdupont
	Duplicate ChangeLog entry removed.

1770.	[func]		fdupont
	Added kea-admin lease-stat-recount command which recounts cached
	statistics in MySQL and PostgreSQL lease databases.
	(Gitlab #1196)

1769.	[build]		fdupont
	Added detection of the musl libc which implements dlclose() as
	a no-operation: this behavior breaks Kea expectations for
	hook library unloading.
	(Gitlab #771)

1768.	[func]*		fdupont
	Removed the support of the Logging toplevel entry. Now loggers must
	be defined in each server toplevel entry.
	(Gitlab #916)

1767.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed unit tests failing on systems where an interface is named	eth0.
	(Gitlab #1043)

1766.	[func]		fdupont
	Optimized the interface manager code and removed the 16 bit limit
	to interface indexes.
	(Gitlab #553)

1765.	[bug]		fdupont
	Corrected a bug in MySQL Config Backend which occasionally caused
	the DHCP servers to overlook some configuration changes. This
	issue could occur when the server fetched configuration changes
	within one second after they they were applied in the database.
	(Gitlab #1247)

1764.	[doc]		fdupont
	Added thread safety consideration sections to library documentations
	in the developer guide.
	(Gitlab #996,#1264)

1763.	[bug]		fdupont
	Changed the way hook libraries are unloaded. Now unload is done
	in two phases: the first phase calls unload() entry points and
	removes callouts, the second phase unmaps hook library memory
	spaces. This should lead to fewer problems including fewer crashes
	at exit time. On the other hand, incorrect libraries can stay
	in memory until exit and prevent any (re)load.
	(Gitlab #1282)

Kea 1.7.9 (development) released on June 24, 2020

1762.	[bug]		fdupont
	Fixed the control command execution: either it was deferred by
	DHCP packet processing or a spurious error message was logged.
	(Gitlab #1234)

1761.	[bug]		fdupont
	Found and fixed a possible source of incorrect statistics cached
	in MySQL and PostgreSQL lease databases which in some cases
	made servers fail to start.
	(Gitlab #944,#1196)

1760.	[bug]		razvan
	Fixed log message on DHCPv6 IA_NA lease renew.
	(Gitlab #1276)

1759.	[bug]*		fdupont
	Fixed the way configuration global entries are parsed in DHCPv4
	and DHCPv6 servers. We expect that the change will not be visible
	for sane configurations.
	(Gitlab #1245)

1758.	[func]*		fdupont
	Earlier Kea versions converted "comment" entries to "user-context"
	scope in the configuration when using config-get. This backwards
	compatibility has now been removed. This may affect users who use
	config-get or config-write commands and use comments in their
	configurations.
	(Gitlab #1100)

1757.	[bug]		fdupont
	config-backend-pull commands were fixed to be applied to the
	current configuration
	(Gitlab #1189)

1756.	[bug]		fdupont
	Made the parking lot API generic thread safe.
	(Gitlab #1255)

1755.	[func]*		fdupont
	Implemented various race avoidance mechanisms in the multi-threaded
	packet processing: only one query from the same client is processed,
	subsequent queries from the same client are dropped at the exception
	of the most recent which will be processed after. When picking
	a free address or prefix from a pool the resource is considered
	as not free for other threads. This is used by the lease commands
	hooks library to avoid conflicts with a minimal overhead.
	Finally individual lease reclamation is exclusive of multi-threaded
	packet processing.
	(Gitlab #1147)

Kea 1.7.8 (development) released on May 27, 2020

1754.	[func]		marcin
	Improved the procedure of restarting the servers in the terminated
	HA state. The servers can now be restarted sequentially without the
	risk of returning to the terminated state right after restart.
	Previously, the servers had to be both shutdown before being
	restarted to avoid returning to the terminated state.
	(Gitlab #1205)

1753.	[func]*		marcin
	Extended the response to the status-get command to include
	information about the progress of the failover procedure
	while the active servers are in the communication interrupted
	state. The new data allow for monitoring the number of clients
	attempting to communicate with the partner which is presumably
	offline, total number of packets sent to the partner and so on.
	The syntax of the response was modified and is incompatible with
	previous Kea versions.
	(Gitlab #1087)

1752.	[doc]		tmark
	Added documentation for the Leasequery premium
	hook library to the ARM.
	(Gitlab #1180)

1751.	[perf]		marcin
	Corrected performance issue occurring while loading large configurations
	via the MySQL Config Backend. Improper database indexing caused long
	server startup time as well as long time to respond to various
	commands, such as subnet4-list or subnet6-list.
	(Gitlab #1242)

1750.	[func]		razvan
	Refactored HooksManager so that no lazy initialization is possible
	from dhcp processing functions. The function getHooksManager is now
	private.
	(Gitlab #1227)

1749.	[func]		fdupont
	When the version is a development (vs. stable) one (second
	number is odd, e.g. in 1.7.x) a server or agent logs a
	warning to dissuade use in production.
	(Gitlab #1184)

1748.	[func]		marcin
	Added two extensions to the HA hooks library. Firstly, the active
	servers no longer wait for the lease update acknowledgments from
	the backup servers. Secondly, the new passive-backup mode allows
	for running a single active server with a number of backup
	servers.
	(Gitlab #999)

1747.	[bug]		fdupont
	Multi-threading and congestion handling were made incompatible:
	when both are enabled by a configuration the dhcp-queue-control is
	silently disabled, when packet-queue-size is not 0 and the
	multi-threading packet queue is full the oldest packet is dropped
	to make room for a new received one.
	(Gitlab #1173)

1746.	[bug]		fdupont
	lease4-add and lease6-add commands now return an error when the
	lease already exists.
	(Gitlab #1170)

1745.	[bug]		fdupont
	Made state model and external sockets thread safe.
	(Gitlab #1095)

1744.	[func]		razvan
	Stopping packet processing when changing or reloading configuration.
	(Gitlab #1188)

Kea 1.7.7 (development) released on Apr 29, 2020

1743.	[doc]		tomek
	ISC now provides a dashboard solution for Kea. Added documentation
	pointers about the ISC Stork project.
	(Gitlab #1191)

1742.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new cumulative statistics: for each assigned IPv4 address,
	IPv6 NA address or IPv6 PD prefixes cumulative-assigned-addresses,
	cumulative-assigned-nas or cumulative-assigned-pds global and
	per subnet is increased. A spelling error in the result-set of
	the stat-lease4-get of the stat cmds hook library was fixed.
	(Gitlab #816)

1741.	[func]		fdupont
	When the MySQL InnoDB reports a deadlock (very rare event)
	the failed query is rerun.
	(Gitlab #1160)

1740.	[bug]		fdupont
	Incorrect signal handling in the process library (used for
	control agent, d2 and netconf server but not by DHCPv4 or
	DHCPv6 servers) was replaced by the boost ASIO signal set.
	(Gitlab #1096)

1739.	[func]		razvan
	Added multi threading configuration parameters which can be used
	to adjust server performance according to setup resources and needs:
	enable-multi-threading, thread-pool-size and packet-queue-size.
	There is also an automatic detection implemented by using
	thread-pool-size set to 0. However, the packet-queue-size must be
	manually configured and does not scale automatically.
	The temporary -N command line option was removed.
	The multi threading is disabled by default.
	(Gitlab #893)

1738.	[func]		fdupont
	Added new global parameters statistic-default-sample-count and
	statistic-default-sample-age to set the default values used
	for sample keeping limits.
	(Gitlab #1005)

1737.	[func]		tmark
	Added store-extended-info parameter to kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6
	which enables the storage of additional information per lease.
	This has been added in anticipation of supporting LeaseQuery.
	(Gitlab #1010)

1736.	[doc]		fdupont
	A default logging syntax has been updated to reflect recently added
	multi-threading capabilities. The process is now identified by
	name/process-id.thread-id, e.g. kea-dhcp4.dhcpsrv/8475.12345, where
	12345 is the thread-id. Its exact syntax is OS dependent. The
	logging syntax can be tweaked using `pattern` option for logging.
	(Gitlab #1150)

Kea 1.7.6 (development) released on Mar 25, 2020

1735.	[func]		wlodek
	Added clean output mode to perfdhcp with configurable separator
	for periodic reports.
	(Gitlab #1046)

1734.	[doc]		vicky
	A list of supported OSes is now described in a separate
	platforms.rst file.
	(Gitlab #1055)

1733.	[func]		tmark
	Added lease4-resend-ddns and lease6-resend-ddns commands to
	the Lease Commands hook library.  These commands may be used to
	instruct kea-dhcp4 or kea-dhcp6 to resend a request to update a
	lease's DNS entries to kea-dhcp-ddns.
	(Gitlab #1106)

1732.	[func]		marcin
	Client classes specified within host reservations can be used
	to influence subnet choice within a shared network and pool
	selection within a subnet.
	(Gitlab #1139)

1731.	[func]		razvan
	The NameChangeSender class is thread safe, making DNS updates
	compatible with multi-threading packet processing.
	(Gitlab #1148)

1730.	[func]		razvan
	Added -N command line switch that enables experimental multi-threading
	support. Number of threads can be specified (e.g. -N8) or Kea can be
	told to autodetect number of CPU threads (-N0). This feature is
	experimental. It hasn't been tested extensively and is known to cause
	problems with DDNS and HA. Do not use in production!
	(Gitlab #893)

1729.	[func]		razvan
	The RAII MultiThreadingCriticalSection class is now able to
	automatically stop and start the packet thread pool in order to
	perform server configuration and avoid race conditions in non
	thread safe code.
	(Gitlab #1016)

1728.	[bug]		tmark
	Memfile now supports commas in the hostname and user-context
	columns.  Commas in either column now escaped as "&#x2c" when
	written out, and unescaped when read back in.
	(Gitlab #608)

1727.	[bug]		tmark
	When shutting down due to lost backend database connectivity,
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6 processes will exit with a non-zero value.
	This was temporarily altered by #1108. In addition, the "shutdown"
	command now supports an "exit-value" argument.
	(Gitlab #1115)

1726.	[func]		razvan
	Handling SKIP and DROP state in hooks so that the same operation
	is not performed multiple times. Some hooks will throw exceptions
	if the pktX_receive or pktX_send is handled by other hooks, in
	such case, the configuration order of the hooks must be changed.
	(Gitlab #1088)

Kea 1.7.5 (development) released on Feb 26, 2020

1725.	[func]		wlodek
	Added perfdhcp command option to enable checking address
	and/or prefix uniqueness.
	(Gitlab #1021)

1724.	[func]		razvan
	Added packet thread pool in dhcpv4 and dhcpv6 servers. It adds
	the ability to handle processPacket function on multiple threads.
	When enabled, parked packets are also added to the queue of items
	to be handles by the thread pool. The packet thread pool is
	currently disabled and there is no option to enable it yet.
	(Gitlab #892)

1723.	[func]		tmark
	Hostname sanitizing is now globally enabled by default.  Prior
	to this it was disabled.
	(Gitlab #1048)

1722.	[bug]		razvan
	Compilation fix for MySQL/MariaDB on Ubuntu 19.10.
	(Gitlab #1071)

1721.	[func]*		fdupont
	Added multi_threading_compatible function in hooks to retrieve
	the compatibility with multi-threading. This function is called
	when the library is loaded and if it reports 0 (incompatible) and
	multi-threading is enabled, then the configuration will be
	rejected. The absence of this function from the library defaults
	to incompatibility with multi-threading. All hooks and premium
	hooks must be updated to be able to be used with multi-threading.

	High Availability hooks library supports controlled maintenance
	of the servers. The new ha-maintenance-start command puts one
	of the servers in the partner-in-maintenance state and causes
	this server to take over the entire DHCP traffic directed to the
	HA service. The second server in the in-maintenance state can be
	safely shutdown for the maintenance. This new mechanism solves
	the problem present in earlier versions of Kea when the

	Added a generic ThreadPool class which can be used to process
	functor work items in parallel, on multiple threads. It uses
	a queue container to manage the work items.
	(Gitlab #883)

	(Gitlab #572)

1682.	[bug]*		tmark
	Added logic to core code and HA hook lib to allow HA peers
	to detect and handle out of bandwidth socket events.  This
	corrects a defect introduced in Kea 1.6.0 that can cause
	an HA server to become unresponsive when an HA socket has
	been closed by a peer.  Note that there is a change to the
	signature of the external socket callback handler invoked
	by IfaceMgr.  Custome hook libraries happen register external

	Kea no longer uses the .../var/kea directory, for instance pid
	files are now in .../var/run/kea.
	BEWARE this applies to the kea-dhcp6-serverid file so if the

	DHCPv6 server avoids collisions between prefixes that are allocated
	as a result of receiving hints from the clients. Previously the

	libraries (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=175453).
	While not all tests still pass, main BIND 10 programs should
	generally work correctly.  Still, there can be odd run time
	behavior such as abrupt crash instead of graceful shutdown
	when some fatal event happens, so it's generally discouraged to
	use BIND 10 on FreeBSD 9.1 RELEASE.  According to the above
	bug report for FreeBSD, it seems upgrading or downgrading the

	The "delete record" interface of the database based data source
	was extended so that the parameter includes reversed name in

	accessor implementation if reversed names are more convenient
	for the delete operation.  This was the case for the SQLite3

	This means existing configuration may not work after an update.
	If "config show data_sources/classes/CH[0]" on bindctl contains a
	"static" type of data source, you'll need to update it as follows:
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/type MasterFiles

	incompatibilities: name fields of RDATA (in NS, SOA, etc) must
	be absolute for now; due to the stricter checks some input that was
	(incorrectly) accepted by the old version may now be rejected;
	command line options and arguments are not compatible.

	Add initial version of a MySQL backend for the DHCP code.  This
	implements the basic IPv6 lease access functions - add lease, delete
	lease and update lease.  The backend is enabled by specifying

	switch, the MySQL code is not compiled, so leaving BIND 10 able to

	Fixed a problem that shutting down BIND 10 kept some of the
	processes alive.  It was two-fold: when the main bind10 process
	started as a root, started b10-sockcreator with the privilege, and
	then dropped the privilege, the bind10 process cannot kill the
	sockcreator via signal any more (when it has to), but it kept
	sending the signal and didn't stop.  Also, when running on Python
	3.1 (or older), the sockcreator had some additional file
	descriptor open, which prevented it from exiting even after the
	bind10 process terminated.  Now the bind10 process simply gives up
	killing a subprocess if it fails due to lack of permission, and it
	makes sure the socket creator is spawned without any unnecessary
	FDs open.

	Memory footprint of the in-memory data source has been
	substantially improved.  For example, b10-auth now requires much
	less memory than BIND 9 named for loading and serving the same
	zone in-memory.  This is a transparent change in terms of user
	operation; there's no need to update or change the configuration
	to enable this feature.
	Notes: multiple instances of b10-auth still make separate copies
	of the memory image.  Also, loading zones in memory still suspends
	query processing, so manual reloading or reloading after incoming
	transfer may cause service disruption for huge zones.

	The logger now uses a lockfile named `logger_lockfile' that is
	created in the local state directory to mutually separate
	individual logging operations from various processes. This is

	should be writable and perhaps have g+s mode bit so that the
	`logger_lockfile` can be opened by a group of processes.

	Created a new tool b10-dbutil, that can check and upgrade database
	schemas, to be used when incompatible changes are introduced in the
	backend database schema. Currently it only supports sqlite3 databases.
	Note: there's no schema change that requires this utility as of

	run it at the moment.
	(Trac #963, git 49ba2cf8ac63246f389ab5e8ea3b3d081dba9adf)

412.	[func]		jelte
	Added a command-line option '--clear-config' to bind10, which causes
	the system to create a backup of the existing configuration database
	file, and start out with a clean default configuration. This can be
	used if the configuration file is corrupted to the point where it
	cannot be read anymore, and BIND 10 refuses to start. The name of

	Python CC library now ensures write operations transmit all given
	data (unless an error happens).  Previously it didn't check the

	Make sure disabling Boost threads if the default configuration is
	to disable it for the system.  This fixes a crash and hang up
	problem on OpenBSD, where the use of Boost thread could be
	different in different program files depending on the order of

	The configure option for botan (--with-botan=PATH) is replaced by
	--with-botan-config=PATH, which takes a full path to a botan-config

	libdns++: masterLoad() didn't accept comments placed at the end of
	an RR.  Due to this the in-memory data source cannot load a master
	file for a signed zone even if it's preprocessed with BIND 9's
	named-compilezone.
	Note: this fix is considered temporary and still only accepts some
	limited form of such comments.  The main purpose is to allow the
	in-memory data source to load any signed or unsigned zone files as
	long as they are at least normalized with named-compilezone.

	Configuration commands in bindctl now check for list indices if

	Due to the socket creator changes, b10-auth and b10-resolver
	are no longer needed to start as root. They are started as
	the user they should be running, so they no longer have
	the -u flag for switching the user after initialization.
	Note: this change broke backward compatibility to boss component
	configuration.  If your b10-config.db contains "setuid" for
	Boss.components, you'll need to remove that entry by hand before
	starting BIND 10.

	b10-resolver ignored default configuration parameters if listen_on
	failed (this can easily happen especially for a test environment

	b10-xfrout: ACLs for xfrout can now be configured per zone basis.
	A per zone ACL is part of a more general zone configuration.  A

	> config add Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl
	> config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl[0] {"action": "REJECT"}
	The previous global ACL (query_acl) was renamed to transfer_acl,
	which now works as the default ACL.  Note: backward compatibility

	Resolved that the stats module wasn't configurable in bindctl in
	spite of its having configuration items. The configuration part
	was removed from the original spec file "stats.spec" and was
	placed in a new spec file "stats-schema.spec". Because it means
	definitions of statistics items. The command part is still
	there. Thus stats module currently has no its own configuration,
	and the items in "stats-schema.spec" are neither visible nor
	configurable through bindctl. "stats-schema.spec" is shared with
	stats module and stats-httpd module, and maybe with other
	statistical modules in future. "stats.spec" has own configuration
	and commands of stats module, if it requires.

	Added the HTTP/XML interface (b10-stats-httpd) to the
	statistics feature in BIND 10. b10-stats-httpd is a standalone
	HTTP server and it requests statistics data to the stats
	daemon (b10-stats) and sends it to HTTP clients in XML
	format. Items of the data collected via b10-stats-httpd
	are almost equivalent to ones which are collected via
	bindctl. Since it also can send XSL (Extensible Stylesheet
	Language) document and XSD (XML Schema definition) document,
	XML document is human-friendly to view through web browsers
	and its data types are strictly defined.

	change #135. (Trac #462, svn r4081)

140.	[func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:
	  ... "auth.queries.tcp": 1, "auth.queries.udp": 1 ...
	Using the "Auth sendstats" command you can make b10-auth send the
	counters to b10-stats immediately.
	(Trac #347, svn r4026)

139.	[build]		jreed
	Introduced configure option and make targets for generating
	Python code coverage report. This adds new make targets:
	report-python-coverage and clean-python-coverage. The C++
	code coverage targets were renamed to clean-cpp-coverage
	and report-cpp-coverage. (Trac #362, svn r4023)

138.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a configuration interface to support in memory
	data sources.  For example, the following command to bindctl
	will configure a memory data source containing the "example.com"
	zone with the zone file named "example.com.zone":
	> config set Auth/datasources/ [{"type": "memory", "zones": \
	 [{"origin": "example.com", "file": "example.com.zone"}]}]
	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be
	configured explicitly.  To disable it again, specify a null list
	for Auth/datasources:
	> config set Auth/datasources/ []
	Notes: it's currently for class IN only.  The zone files are not
	actually loaded into memory yet (which will soon be implemented).
	This is an experimental feature and the syntax may change in
	future versions.

	consider this as part of the generalization work).
	(Trac #422, svn r3866)

129.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added new functions masterLoad() for loading master

	The Nameserver Address Store (NSAS) component has been added. It takes
	care of choosing an IP address of a nameserver when a zone needs to be
	contacted.
	(Trac #356, Trac #408, svn r3823)

bind10-devel-20101201 released on December 01, 2010

125.	[func]		jelte
	Added support for addressing individual list items in bindctl
	configuration commands; If you have an element that is a list, you
	can use foo[X]		integer
	(starting at 0)
	(Trac #405, svn r3739)

124.	[bug]		jreed
	Fix some wrong version reporting. Now also show the version
	for the component and BIND 10 suite. (Trac #302, svn r3696)

123.	[bug]		jelte
	src/bin/bindctl printed values had the form of python literals
	(e.g. 'True'), while the input requires valid JSON (e.g. 'true').
	Output changed to JSON format for consistency. (svn r3694)

122.	[func]		stephen
	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

121.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is
	not much of real use, however, because no protocol support was
	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

120.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

117.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the
	support of in memory data source.  This is an intermediate step to
	the bigger feature, and is not yet actually usable in practice.
	(Trac #399, svn r3590)

116.	[bug]		jerry
	src/bin/xfrout: Xfrout and Auth will communicate by long tcp
	connection, Auth needs to make a new connection only on the first
	time or if an error occurred.
	(Trac #299, svn r3482)

115.	[func]*		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Changed DNS message flags and section names from
	separate classes to simpler enums, considering the balance between
	type safety and usability.  API has been changed accordingly.
	More documentation and tests were provided with these changes.
	(Trac #358, r3439)

114.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported clang++.  Note: Boost >= 1.44 is required.
	(Trac #365, svn r3383)

113.	[func]*		zhanglikun
	Folder name 'utils'(the folder in /src/lib/python/isc/) has been
	renamed	to 'util'. Programs that used 'import isc.utils.process'
	now need to use 'import isc.util.process'. The folder
	/src/lib/python/isc/Util is removed since it isn't used by any
	program. (Trac #364, r3382)

112.	[func]		zhang likun
	Add one mixin class to override the naive serve_forever() provided
	in python library socketserver. Instead of polling for shutdown
	every poll_interval seconds, one socketpair is used to wake up
	the waiting server. (Trac #352, svn r3366)

111.	[bug]*		Vaner
	Make sure process xfrin/xfrout/zonemgr/cmdctl can be stopped
	properly when user enter "ctrl+c" or 'Boss shutdown' command
	through bindctl.  The ZonemgrRefresh.run_timer and
	NotifyOut.dispatcher spawn a thread themselves.
	(Trac #335, svn r3273)

110.	[func]		Vaner
	Added isc.net.check module to check ip addresses and ports for
	correctness and isc.net.addr to hold IP address. The bind10, xfrin
	and cmdctl programs are modified to use it.
	(Trac #353, svn r3240)

109.	[func]		naokikambe
	Added the initial version of the stats module for the statistics
	feature of BIND 10, which supports the restricted features and
	items and reports via bindctl command. (Trac #191, r3218)
	Added the document of the stats module, which is about how stats
	module collects the data (Trac #170, [wiki:StatsModule])

108.	[func]		jerry
	src/bin/zonemgr: Provide customizable configurations for
	lowerbound_refresh, lowerbound_retry, max_transfer_timeout and
	jitter_scope. (Trac #340, r3205)

107.	[func]		likun
	Remove the parameter 'db_file' for command 'retransfer' of
	xfrin module. xfrin.spec will not be generated by script.
	(Trac #329, r3171)

106.	[bug]		likun
	When xfrin can't connect with one zone's master, it should tell
	the bad news to zonemgr, so that zonemgr can reset the timer for
	that zone. (Trac #329, r3170)

105.	[bug]		Vaner
	Python processes: they no longer take 100% CPU while idle
	due to a busy loop in reading command session in a nonblocking way.
	(Trac #349, svn r3153), (Trac #382, svn r3294)

104.	[bug]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: zonemgr should be attempting to refresh expired zones.
	(Trac #336, r3139)

103.	[bug]		jerry
	lib/python/isc/log: Fixed an issue with python logging,
	python log shouldn't die with OSError. (Trac #267, r3137)

102.	[build]		jinmei
	Disable threads in ASIO to minimize build time dependency.
	(Trac #345, r3100)

101.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Completed Opcode and Rcode implementation with more
	tests and documentation.  API is mostly the same but the
	validation was a bit tightened. (Trac #351, svn r3056)

100.	[func]		Vaner
	Python processes: support naming of python processes so
	they're not all called python3.
	(Trac #322, svn r3052)

99.	[func]*		jinmei
	Introduced a separate EDNS class to encapsulate EDNS related
	information more cleanly.  The related APIs are changed a bit,
	although it won't affect most of higher level applications.
	(Trac #311, svn r3020)

98.	[build]		jinmei
	The ./configure script now tries to search some common include
	paths for boost header files to minimize the need for explicit
	configuration with --with-boost-include. (Trac #323, svn r3006)

97.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a micro benchmark test for query processing of b10-auth.
	(Trac #308, svn r2982)

96.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed two small issues with configure: Do not set CXXFLAGS so that
	it can be customized; Make sure --disable-static works.
	(Trac #325, r2976)

bind10-devel-20100917 released on September 17, 2010

95.	[doc, bug]	jreed
	Add b10-zonemgr manual page. Update other docs to introduce
	this secondary manager.
	bin/xfrout and bin/zonemgr: Fixed some stderr output.
	(Trac #341, svn r2951)
	(Trac #342, svn r2949)

94.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/xfrout:  Fixed a problem in xfrout where only 2 or 3 RRs
	were used per DNS message in the xfrout stream.
	(Trac #334, r2931)

93.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: A DS query could crash the library (and therefore,
	e.g. the authoritative server) if some RR of the same apex name
	is stored in the hot spot cache. (Trac #307, svn r2923)

92.	[func]*		jelte
	libdns_python (the python wrappers for libdns++) has been renamed
	to pydnspp (Python DNS++). Programs and libraries that used
	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

88.	[func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

87.	[func]		zhanglikun
	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one
	of the co-operating processes of BIND 10, which keeps track of
	timers and other information necessary for BIND 10 to act as a
	slave. (Trac #215, svn r2737)

85.	[build]*		jinmei
	Build programs using dynamic link by default.  A new configure
	option --enable-static-link is provided to force static link for
	executable programs.  Statically linked programs can be run on a
	debugger more easily and would be convenient for developers.
	(Trac #309, svn r2723)

bind10-devel-20100812 released on August 12, 2010

84.	[bug]		jinmei, jerry
	This is a quick fix patch for the issue: AXFR fails half the
	time because of connection problems. xfrout client will make
	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

83.	[build]*		jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

82.	[func]		jinmei
	bin/auth: Added -u option to change the effective process user
	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

81.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a C++ framework for micro benchmark tests.  A supplemental
	library functions to build query data for the tests were also
	provided. (Trac #241, svn r2664)

80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or
	non-running modules (for the latter, this is until we have a
	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's
	already running (listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

73.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

71.	[func]		each
	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

70.	[func]		each
	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

69.	[func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

68.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c (--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file',
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

67.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

66.	[bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)

65.	[func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

64.	[func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

63.	[func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

62.	[func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

61.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc, bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Trac #136, svn r2147)

54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(),
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process,
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't
	be removed, exit from python.
	(Trac #151, svn r2091)

bind10-devel-20100602 released on June 2, 2010

51.	[build]		jelte
	lib/python: Add bind10_config.py module for paths and
	possibly other configure-time variables. Allow some components
	to find spec files in build tree when ran from source.
	(Trac #223)

50.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

48.	[func]		jelte
	bin/auth: Use asio's io_service for the msgq handling.
	(svn r2007)

47.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/cmdctl: Add value/type check for commands sent to
	cmdctl. (Trac #201, svn r1959)

43.	[func]		jelte
	lib/cc: Message queuing on cc channel. (Trac #58, svn r1870)

42.	[func]		jelte

	Module descriptions in spec files. (Trac #90, svn r1856)

40.	[build]		jreed
	Report detected features and configure settings at end of
	configure output. (svn r1836)

39.	[func]*		each
	Renamed libauth to libdatasrc.

38.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.
	Remove unused socket file when Xfrout process exits. Make sure Xfrout
	exit by itself when it receives SIGINT, instead of being killed by the
	signal SIGTERM or SIGKILL sent from boss.
	(Trac #135, #151, #134, svn r1797)

37.	[build]		jinmei
	Check for the availability of python-config. (Trac #159,
	svn r1794)

36.	[func]		shane
	bin/bind10:	Miscellaneous code cleanups and improvements.
	(Trac #40, svn r2012)

35.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/bindctl: fixed a bug that it didn't accept IPv6 addresses as
	command arguments. (Trac #219, svn r2022)

34.	[bug]		jinmei
	bin/xfrin: fixed several small bugs with many additional unit
	tests.  Fixes include: IPv6 transport support, resource leak,
	and non IN class support. (Trac #185, svn r2000)

33.	[bug]		each
	bin/auth: output now prepended with "[b10-auth]" (Trac
	#109, svn r1985)

32.	[func]*		each
	bin/auth: removed custom query-processing code, changed
	boost::asio code to use plain asio instead, and added asio
	headers to the source tree.  This allows building without
	using an external boost library. (Trac #163, svn r1983)

31.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/dns: added a separate signature for Name::split() as a
	convenient wrapper for common usage. (Trac #49, svn r1903)

30.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: parameter validation of Name::split() was not sufficient,
	and invalid parameters could cause integer overflow and make the

LEGEND
[bug]   General bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] Compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc]   Update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func]  new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[sec]   Security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	security patch releases.
[perf]  Performance related change.

*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

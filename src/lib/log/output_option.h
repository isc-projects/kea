/// \brief Logger Output Option
///
/// The logging configuration options are a list of logger specifications, each
/// with one or more output options.  This class represents an output option;
/// one or more of these are attached to a LoggerSpecification object which is
/// then passed to the LoggerManager to configure the logger.
///
/// Although there are three distinct output types (console, file, syslog) and
/// the options for each do not really overlap.  Although it is tempting to
/// define a base OutputOption class and derive a class for each type
/// (ConsoleOutputOptions etc.), it would be messy to use in practice.  At
/// some point the exact class would have to be known to get the class-specific
/// options and the (pointer to) the base class cast to the appropriate type.
/// Instead, this "struct" contains the union of all output options; it is up
/// to the caller to cherry-pick the members it needs.
///
/// One final note: this object holds data and does no computation.  For this
/// reason, it is a "struct" and members are accessed directly instead of
/// through methods.

/// \brief Mapped-file based Memory Segment class.
///
/// This implementation of \c MemorySegment uses a concrete file to be mapped
/// into memory.  Multiple processes can share the same mapped memory image.
///
/// This class provides two operation modes: read-only and read-write.
/// A \c MemorySegmentMapped object in the read-only mode cannot modify the
/// mapped memory image or other internal maintenance data of the object;
/// In the read-write mode the object can allocate or deallocate memory
/// from the mapped image, and the owner process can change the content.
///
/// This class does not provide any synchronization mechanism between
/// read-only and read-write objects that share the same mapped image;
/// in fact, the expected usage is the application (or a system of related
/// processes) ensures there's at most one read-write object and if there's
/// such an object, no read-only object shares the image.  If an application
/// uses this class beyond that expectation, it's the application's
/// responsibility to provide necessary synchronization between the processes.

# This script is used for testing the ProcessSpawn utility class. This
# class is used to fork and execute a new process. It also allows for
# checking the exit code returned when the process terminates.
# The unit tests execute this script via ProcessSpawn class with
# different command line parameters to test the class functionality.
#
# In particular, they check if the class correctly records the exit code
# returned. The exit code returned is controlled by the caller. It is
# possible to explictily specify the exit code to be returned using
# the command line options. It is also possible to specify that the
# exit code is "unique" for the process, so as the test can check
# that two distinct processes spawned by the same ProcessSpawn
# object may return different status code. The command line of this
# script also allows for forcing the process to sleep so as the
# test has much enough time to verify that the convenience methods
# checking the state of the process, i.e. process running or not.

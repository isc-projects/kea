This directory holds implementation for DHCP libraries:

libdhcp++ - this is a generic purpose DHCP library. Please be careful
what is put here. It is going to be shared by various servers (the "regular"
one and the embedded as well), clients, relays and performance tools.

libdhcpsrv - Server specific code goes in here. It will be used by
dhcp4 and dhcp6 server.

``libdhcp_radius.so``: RADIUS Server Support
============================================

This hook library allows the Kea DHCP servers to use the RADIUS protocol to
authorize DHCP clients through the access service, or for DHCP lease journaling
through the accounting service. For details on RADIUS in Kea, please see
:ref:`radius`.

.. note::

    :ischooklib:`libdhcp_radius.so` is part of the open source code and is
    available to every Kea user.
    It was previously available only to ISC customers with a paid support contract.

	statistics which are increased when an incoming packet
	was dropped because it was queued and the queue is full.

	statistics which are increased when an incoming packet
	has to be dropped according to protocol specifications.

	Added "pkt4-admin-filtered" and "pkt6-admin-filtered"
	statistics which are increased when an incoming packet

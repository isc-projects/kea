$NAMESPACE isc::dhcp

% DHCP6_CCSESSION_STARTED control channel session started on socket %1
A debug message issued during startup after the IPv6 DHCP server has
successfully established a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP6_CCSESSION_STARTING starting control channel session, specfile: %1
This debug message is issued just before the IPv6 DHCP server attempts
to establish a session with the BIND 10 control channel.

% DHCP6_CLIENTID_MISSING mandatory client-id option is missing, message from %1 dropped
This error message indicates that the received message is being dropped
because it does not include the mandatory client-id option necessary for
address assignment.  The most likely cause is a problem with the client.

% DHCP6_COMMAND_RECEIVED received command %1, arguments: %2
A debug message listing the command (and possible arguments) received
from the BIND 10 control system by the IPv6 DHCP server.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_COMPLETE DHCPv6 server has completed configuration: %1
This is an informational message announcing the successful processing of a
new configuration. it is output during server startup, and when an updated
configuration is committed by the administrator.  Additional information
may be provided.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL failed to load configuration: %1
This critical error message indicates that the initial DHCPv6
configuration has failed. The server will start, but nothing will be
served until the configuration has been corrected.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_NEW_SUBNET a new subnet has been added to configuration: %1
This is an informational message reporting that the configuration has
been extended to include the specified subnet.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_OPTION_DUPLICATE multiple options with the code: %1 added to the subnet: %2
This warning message is issued on an attempt to configure multiple options with the
same option code for the particular subnet. Adding multiple options is uncommon
for DHCPv6, but it is not prohibited.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_START DHCPv6 server is processing the following configuration: %1
This is a debug message that is issued every time the server receives a
configuration. That happens start up and also when a server configuration
change is committed by the administrator.

% DHCP6_CONFIG_UPDATE updated configuration received: %1
A debug message indicating that the IPv6 DHCP server has received an
updated configuration from the BIND 10 configuration system.

% DHCP6_DB_BACKEND_STARTED lease database started (type: %1, name: %2)
This informational message is printed every time the IPv6 DHCP server
is started.  It indicates what database backend type is being to store
lease and other information.

% DHCP6_HOOK_PACKET_RCVD_SKIP received DHCPv6 packet was dropped, because a callout set skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on pkt6_receive
hook point sets skip flag. For this particular hook point, the setting
of the flag by a callout instructs the server to drop the packet.

% DHCP6_HOOK_PACKET_SEND_SKIP Prepared DHCPv6 response was not sent, because a callout set skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on pkt6_send
hook point sets skip flag. For this particular hook point, the setting
of the flag by a callout instructs the server to drop the packet. This
effectively means that the client will not get any response, even though
the server processed client's request and acted on it (e.g. possibly
allocated a lease).

% DHCP6_HOOK_SUBNET6_SELECT_SKIP No subnet was selected, because a callout set skip flag.
This debug message is printed when a callout installed on subnet6_select
hook point sets a skip flag. It means that the server was told that no subnet
should be selected. This severely limits further processing - server will be only
able to offer global options. No addresses or prefixes could be assigned.

% DHCP6_LEASE_ADVERT lease %1 advertised (client duid=%2, iaid=%3)
This debug message indicates that the server successfully advertised
a lease. It is up to the client to choose one server out of the
advertised servers and continue allocation with that server. This
is a normal behavior and indicates successful operation.

% DHCP6_LEASE_ADVERT_FAIL failed to advertise a lease for client duid=%1, iaid=%2
This message indicates that the server failed to advertise (in response to
received SOLICIT) a lease for a given client. There may be many reasons for
such failure. Each specific failure is logged in a separate log entry.

% DHCP6_LEASE_ALLOC lease %1 has been allocated (client duid=%2, iaid=%3)
This debug message indicates that the server successfully granted (in
response to client's REQUEST message) a lease. This is a normal behavior
and indicates successful operation.

% DHCP6_LEASE_ALLOC_FAIL failed to grant a lease for client duid=%1, iaid=%2
This message indicates that the server failed to grant (in response to
received REQUEST) a lease for a given client. There may be many reasons for
such failure. Each specific failure is logged in a separate log entry.

% DHCP6_LEASE_WITHOUT_DUID lease for address %1 does not have a DUID
This error message indicates a database consistency failure. The lease
database has an entry indicating that the given address is in use,
but the lease does not contain any client identification. This is most
likely due to a software error: please raise a bug report. As a temporary
workaround, manually remove the lease entry from the database.

% DHCP6_NOT_RUNNING IPv6 DHCP server is not running
A warning message is issued when an attempt is made to shut down the
IPv6 DHCP server but it is not running.

% DHCP6_NO_INTERFACES failed to detect any network interfaces
During startup the IPv6 DHCP server failed to detect any network
interfaces and is therefore shutting down.

% DHCP6_OPEN_SOCKET opening sockets on port %1
A debug message issued during startup, this indicates that the IPv6 DHCP
server is about to open sockets on the specified port.

% DHCP6_PACKET_PARSE_FAIL failed to parse incoming packet
The IPv6 DHCP server has received a packet that it is unable to interpret.

% DHCP6_PACKET_PROCESS_FAIL processing of %1 message received from %2 failed: %3
This is a general catch-all message indicating that the processing of the
specified packet type from the indicated address failed.  The reason is given in the
message.  The server will not send a response but will instead ignore the packet.

% DHCP6_PACKET_RECEIVED %1 packet received
A debug message noting that the server has received the specified type
of packet.  Note that a packet marked as UNKNOWN may well be a valid
DHCP packet, just a type not expected by the server (e.g. it will report
a received OFFER packet as UNKNOWN).

% DHCP6_PACKET_RECEIVE_FAIL error on attempt to receive packet: %1
The IPv6 DHCP server tried to receive a packet but an error
occurred during this attempt. The reason for the error is included in
the message.

% DHCP6_PACKET_SEND_FAIL failed to send DHCPv6 packet: %1
This error is output if the IPv6 DHCP server fails to send an assembled
DHCP message to a client. The reason for the error is included in the
message.

% DHCP6_PACK_FAIL failed to assemble response correctly
This error is output if the server failed to assemble the data to be
returned to the client into a valid packet.  The reason is most likely
to be to a programming error: please raise a bug report.

% DHCP6_PARSER_COMMIT_EXCEPTION parser failed to commit changes
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv6 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but one
of them failed to commit its changes due to a low-level system exception
being raised.  Additional messages may be output indicating the reason.

% DHCP6_PARSER_COMMIT_FAIL parser failed to commit changes: %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of the IPv6 DHCP
server configuration, a set of parsers were successfully created, but
one of them failed to commit its changes.  The reason for the failure
is given in the message.

% DHCP6_PARSER_CREATED created parser for configuration element %1
A debug message output during a configuration update of the IPv6 DHCP
server, notifying that the parser for the specified configuration element
has been successfully created.

% DHCP6_PARSER_EXCEPTION failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv6 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents of
the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the parsing
actions and committal of changes failed.  The message has been output in
response to a non-BIND 10 exception being raised.  Additional messages
may give further information.

The most likely cause of this is that the specification file for the server
(which details the allowable contents of the configuration) is not correct for
this version of BIND 10.  This former may be the result of an interrupted
installation of an update to BIND 10.

% DHCP6_PARSER_FAIL failed to create or run parser for configuration element %1: %2
On receipt of message containing details to a change of its configuration,
the IPv6 DHCP server failed to create a parser to decode the contents
of the named configuration element, or the creation succeeded but the
parsing actions and committal of changes failed.  The reason for the
failure is given in the message.

% DHCP6_PROCESS_IA_NA_REQUEST server is processing IA_NA option (duid=%1, iaid=%2, hint=%3)
This is a debug message that indicates a processing of received IA_NA
option. It may optionally contain an address that may be used by the server
as a hint for possible requested address.

% DHCP6_QUERY_DATA received packet length %1, data length %2, data is %3
A debug message listing the data received from the client or relay.

% DHCP6_RELEASE address %1 belonging to client duid=%2, iaid=%3 was released properly.
This debug message indicates that an address was released properly. It
is a normal operation during client shutdown.

% DHCP6_RELEASE_FAIL failed to remove lease for address %1 for duid=%2, iaid=%3
This error message indicates that the software failed to remove a
lease from the lease database.  It probably due to an error during a
database operation: resolution will most likely require administrator
intervention (e.g. check if DHCP process has sufficient privileges to
update the database). It may also be triggered if a lease was manually
removed from the database during RELEASE message processing.

% DHCP6_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_DUID client (duid=%1) tried to release address %2, but it belongs to client (duid=%3)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that belongs to a different client. This should not happen in normal
circumstances and may indicate a misconfiguration of the client.  However,
since the client releasing the address will stop using it anyway, there
is a good chance that the situation will correct itself.

% DHCP6_RELEASE_FAIL_WRONG_IAID client (duid=%1) tried to release address %2, but it used wrong IAID (expected %3, but got %4)
This warning message indicates that client tried to release an address
that does belong to it, but the address was expected to be in a different
IA (identity association) container. This probably means that the client's
support for multiple addresses is flawed.

% DHCP6_RELEASE_MISSING_CLIENTID client (address=%1) sent RELEASE message without mandatory client-id
This warning message indicates that client sent RELEASE message without
mandatory client-id option. This is most likely caused by a buggy client
(or a relay that malformed forwarded message). This request will not be
processed and a response with error status code will be sent back.

% DHCP6_RENEW_UNKNOWN_SUBNET RENEW message received from client on unknown subnet (duid=%1, iaid=%2)
A warning message indicating that a client is attempting to renew his lease,
but the server does not have any information about the subnet this client belongs
to. This may mean that faulty the mobile client changed its location and is trying to
renew its old address (client is supposed to send confirm, not rewew in such cases,
according to RFC3315) or the server configuration has changed and information about
existing subnet was removed. Note that in a sense this is worse case of DHCP6_UNKNOWN_RENEW,
as not only the lease is unknown, but also the subnet is. Depending on the reasons
of this condition, it may or may not correct on its own.

% DHCP6_REQUIRED_OPTIONS_CHECK_FAIL %1 message received from %2 failed the following check: %3
This message indicates that received DHCPv6 packet is invalid.  This may be due
to a number of reasons, e.g. the mandatory client-id option is missing,
the server-id forbidden in that particular type of message is present,
there is more than one instance of client-id or server-id present,
etc. The exact reason for rejecting the packet is included in the message.

% DHCP6_RESPONSE_DATA responding with packet type %1 data is %2
A debug message listing the data returned to the client.

% DHCP6_SERVERID_GENERATED server-id %1 has been generated and will be stored in %2
This informational messages indicates that the server was not able to read
its server identifier (DUID) and has generated a new one. This server-id
will be stored in a file and will be read and used during next restart. It
is normal behavior when the server is started for the first time. If
this message is printed every start, please check that the server have
sufficient permission to write its server-id file and that the file is not
corrupt.

Changing the server identifier in a production environment is not
recommended as existing clients will not recognize the server and may go
through a rebind phase. However, they should be able to recover without
losing their leases.

% DHCP6_SERVERID_LOADED server-id %1 has been loaded from file %2
This debug message indicates that the server loaded its server identifier.
That value is sent in all server responses and clients use it to
discriminate between servers. This is a part of normal startup or
reconfiguration procedure.

% DHCP6_SERVERID_WRITE_FAIL server was not able to write its ID to file %1
This warning message indicates that server was not able to write its
server identifier (DUID) to a file. This likely indicates lack of write
permission to a given file or directory. This is not cricital and the
server will continue to operate, but server will generate different DUID
during every start and clients will need to go through a rebind phase
to recover.

% DHCP6_SERVER_FAILED server failed: %1
The IPv6 DHCP server has encountered a fatal error and is terminating.
The reason for the failure is included in the message.

% DHCP6_SESSION_FAIL failed to establish BIND 10 session (%1), running stand-alone
The server has failed to establish communication with the rest of BIND
10 and is running in stand-alone mode.  (This behavior will change once
the IPv6 DHCP server is properly integrated with the rest of BIND 10.)

% DHCP6_SHUTDOWN server shutdown
The IPv6 DHCP server has terminated normally.

% DHCP6_SHUTDOWN_REQUEST shutdown of server requested
This debug message indicates that a shutdown of the IPv6 server has
been requested via a call to the 'shutdown' method of the core Dhcpv6Srv
object.

% DHCP6_SRV_CONSTRUCT_ERROR error creating Dhcpv6Srv object, reason: %1
This error message indicates that during startup, the construction of a
core component within the IPv6 DHCP server (the Dhcpv6 server object)
has failed.  As a result, the server will exit.  The reason for the
failure is given within the message.

% DHCP6_STANDALONE skipping message queue, running standalone
This is a debug message indicating that the IPv6 server is running in
standalone mode, not connected to the message queue.  Standalone mode
is only useful during program development, and should not be used in a
production environment.

% DHCP6_STARTING server starting
This informational message indicates that the IPv6 DHCP server has
processed any command-line switches and is starting.

% DHCP6_START_INFO pid: %1, port: %2, verbose: %3, standalone: %4
This is a debug message issued during the IPv6 DHCP server startup.
It lists some information about the parameters with which the server
is running.

% DHCP6_SUBNET_SELECTED the %1 subnet was selected for client assignment
This is a debug message informing that a given subnet was selected. It will
be used for address and option assignment. This is one of the early steps
in the processing of incoming client message.

% DHCP6_SUBNET_SELECTION_FAILED failed to select a subnet for incoming packet, src=%1 type=%2
This warning message is output when a packet was received from a subnet for
which the DHCPv6 server has not been configured. The cause is most likely due
to a misconfiguration of the server. The packet processing will continue, but
the response will only contain generic configuration parameters and no
addresses or prefixes.

% DHCP6_UNKNOWN_RELEASE received RELEASE from unknown client (duid=%1, iaid=%2)
This warning message is printed when client attempts to release a lease,
but no such lease is known by the server. See DHCP6_UNKNOWN_RENEW for
possible reasons for such behavior.

% DHCP6_UNKNOWN_RENEW received RENEW from client (duid=%1, iaid=%2) in subnet %3
This warning message is printed when client attempts to renew a lease,
but no such lease is known by the server. It typically means that
client has attempted to use its lease past its lifetime: causes of this
include a adjustment of the clients date/time setting or poor support
for sleep/recovery. A properly implemented client will recover from such
a situation by restarting the lease allocation process after receiving
a negative reply from the server.

An alternative cause could be that the server has lost its database
recently and does not recognize its well-behaving clients. This is more
probable if you see many such messages. Clients will recover from this,
but they will most likely get a different IP addresses and experience
a brief service interruption.

This is a simple test environment for running BIND 10 system tests
involving multiple name servers.  It was originally developed for BIND
9, and has been ported to test BIND 10 implementations.  Ideally we
should share the same framework for both versions, so some part of
the original setup are kept, even though they are BIND 9 specific and
not currently used.

Also, these tests generally rely on BIND 9 programs, most commonly its
dig, and will sometimes be its name server (named).  So, the test
environment assumes that there's a source tree of BIND 9 where its
programs are built, and that an environment variable "BIND9_TOP" is
set to point to the top directory of the source tree.

There are multiple test suites, each in a separate subdirectory and
involving a different DNS setup.  They are:

  glue/		Glue handling tests
(the following tests are planned to be added soon)
  dnssec/	DNSSEC tests
  masterfile/	Master file parser
  xfer/		Zone transfer tests

Typically each test suite sets up 2-5 instances of BIND 10 (or BIND 9
named) and then performs one or more tests against them.  Within the
test suite subdirectory, each instance has a separate subdirectory
containing its configuration data.  By convention, these
subdirectories are named "nsx1", "nsx2", etc for BIND 10 ("x" means
BIND 10), and "ns1", "ns2", etc. for BIND 9.

The tests are completely self-contained and do not require access to
the real DNS.  Generally, one of the test servers (ns[x]1) is set up
as a root name server and is listed in the hints file of the others.

To enable all servers to run on the same machine, they bind to
separate virtual IP address on the loopback interface.  ns[x]1 runs on
10.53.0.1, ns[x]2 on 10.53.0.2, etc.  Before running any tests, you
must set up these addresses by running "ifconfig.sh up" as root.

Mac OS X:
If you wish to make the interfaces survive across reboots
copy org.isc.bind.system and org.isc.bind.system to
/Library/LaunchDaemons then run
"launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.isc.bind.system.plist" as
root.

The servers use port 5300 instead of the usual port 53, so they can be
run without root privileges once the interfaces have been set up.

The tests can be run individually like this:

  sh run.sh xfer
  sh run.sh glue
  etc.

To run all the tests, just type "make systest" either on this directory
or on the top source directory.  Note: currently these tests cannot be
run when built under a separate build directory.  Everything must be
run within the original source tree.

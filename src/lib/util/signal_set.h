///
/// This class allows the caller to register one or more signals to catch
/// and process.  Signals may be handled either immediately upon arrival and/or
/// recorded and processed later.  To process signals immediately, the caller
/// must register an "on-receipt" handler.  This handler is expected to return
/// a true or false indicating whether or not the signal has been processed.
/// Signal occurrences that are not processed by the on-receipt handler are
/// remembered by SignalSet for deferred processing.  The caller can then query
/// SignalSet at their discretion to determine if any signal occurrences are
/// pending and process them.
///
/// SignalSet uses an internal handler to catch all registered signals. When
/// a signal arrives the internal handler will first attempt to invoke the
/// on-receipt handler.  If one has been registered it is passed the
/// signal value as an argument and if it returns true upon completion, the
/// internal handler will exit without further action.  If the on-receipt
/// handler returned false or one is not registered, then internal handler
/// will record the signal value for deferred processing.  Note that once a
/// particular signal has been recorded, any further occurrences of that signal
/// will be discarded until the original occurrence has been processed.  This
/// guards against rapid-fire occurrences of the same signal.

/// functions to track a global state of signal registration and received
/// signals' queue.

// relay agent). When told to do so, Kea can check for all of those
// identifier types, but it takes a costly database lookup to do so. It
// is therefore useful from a performance perspective to use only the
// reservation types that are actually used in a given network.

// The example below is not optimal from a performance perspective, but it
// nicely showcases the host reservation capabilities. Please use the minimum
// set of identifier types used in your network.

// check if there are any reservations specified for this client in the
// reservations list, within the subnet (configuration file). If there are
// no reservations there, the server will try to retrieve reservations

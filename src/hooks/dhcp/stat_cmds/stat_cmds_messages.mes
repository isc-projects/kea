% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_FAILED stat-lease4-get command failed: reason: %1
The stat-lease4-get command has failed. The reason for failure is logged.

% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_GET stat-lease4-get command successful, parameters: %1 rows found: %2
The stat-lease4-get command has been successful. The log will contain
the parameters supplied and the number of rows found.

% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_GET_FAILED stat-lease4-get command failed: parameters: %1, reason: %2
The stat-lease4-get command has failed. Both the parameters supplied and
the reason for failure are logged.

% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_GET_INVALID stat-lease4-get command is malformed or invalid, reason: %1
The stat-lease4-get command was either malformed or contained invalid
parameters.  A detailed explanation should be logged.

% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_GET_NO_SUBNETS stat-lease4-get, parameters: %1, %2"
The parameters submitted with stat-lease4-get were valid but excluded all
known subnets.  The parameters supplied along with an explanation should
be logged.

% STAT_CMDS_LEASE4_ORPHANED_STATS stat-lease4-get command omitted statistics for one or more non-existent subnets
Logged at debug log level 40.
During processing the stat-lease4-get found statistics for subnet IDs for
non-existent subnets. These values were omitted from the command response
returned to the user. This may occur when subnets have been removed from
the configuration in a manner that did not also remove the statistics. While
the existence of such statistics is not harmful, steps should be considered
to remove them.  For memfile lease storage, the problem should disappear
upon configuration reload or server restart. For database lease storage the
issue is more complicated and as of Kea 2.0.0 we do not yet have a clean
solution.

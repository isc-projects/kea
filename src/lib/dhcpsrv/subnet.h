/// attached to it. In most cases all devices attached to a single link can
/// share the same parameters. Therefore Subnet holds several values that are
/// typically shared by all hosts: renew timer (T1), rebind timer (T2) and
/// leased addresses lifetime (valid-lifetime). It also holds the set
/// of DHCP option instances configured for the subnet. These options are
/// included in DHCP messages being sent to clients which are connected
/// to the particular subnet.

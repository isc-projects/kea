/// \brief DNS Response Codes (RCODEs) class.
///
/// The \c Rcode class objects represent standard Response Codes
/// (RCODEs) of the header section of DNS messages, and extended response
/// codes as defined in the EDNS specification.
///
/// Originally RCODEs were defined as 4-bit integers (RFC1035), and then
/// extended to 12 bits as part of the %EDNS specification (RFC2671).
/// This API uses the 12-bit version of the definition from the beginning;
/// applications don't have to aware of the original definition except when
/// dealing with the wire-format representation of the %EDNS OPT RR
/// (which is rare).
///
/// Like the \c Opcode class, Rcodes could be represented as bare integers,
/// but we define a separate class to benefit from C++ type safety.
///
/// For convenience we also provide
/// an enum type for pre-defined RCODE values, but it is generally advisable
/// to handle RCODEs through this class.  In fact, public interfaces of
/// this library uses this class to pass or return RCODEs instead of the
/// bare code values.

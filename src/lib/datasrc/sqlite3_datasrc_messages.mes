# \brief Messages for the SQLITE3 data source backend

% DATASRC_SQLITE_CLOSE closing SQLite database
Debug information. The SQLite data source is closing the database file.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_COMPATIBLE_VERSION database schema V%1.%2 not up to date (expecting V%3.%4) but is compatible
The version of the SQLite3 database schema used to hold the zone data
is not the latest one - the current version of BIND 10 was written
with a later schema version in mind.  However, the database is
compatible with the current version of BIND 10, and BIND 10 will run
without any problems.

Consult the release notes for your version of BIND 10.  Depending on
the changes made to the database schema, it is possible that improved
performance could result if the database were upgraded.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_CONNCLOSE Closing sqlite database
The database file is no longer needed and is being closed.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_CONNOPEN Opening sqlite database file '%1'
The database file is being opened so it can start providing data.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_CREATE SQLite data source created
Debug information. An instance of SQLite data source is being created.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_DESTROY SQLite data source destroyed
Debug information. An instance of SQLite data source is being destroyed.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_DROPCONN SQLite3 database '%1' is being closed
The object around a database connection is being destroyed. If the
SQLite3 database file was open, it will be closed now.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_ENCLOSURE looking for zone containing '%1'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is trying to identify which zone
should hold this domain.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_ENCLOSURE_NOT_FOUND no zone contains '%1'
Debug information. The last SQLITE_ENCLOSURE query was unsuccessful; there's
no such zone in our data.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FIND looking for RRset '%1/%2'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is looking up a resource record
set.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDADDRS looking for A/AAAA addresses for '%1'
Debug information. The data source is looking up the addresses for given
domain name.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDADDRS_BAD_CLASS class mismatch looking for addresses ('%1' and '%2')
The SQLite data source was looking up A/AAAA addresses, but the data source
contains different class than the query was for.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDEXACT looking for exact RRset '%1/%2'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is looking up an exact resource
record.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDEXACT_BAD_CLASS class mismatch looking for an RRset ('%1' and '%2')
The SQLite data source was looking up an exact RRset, but the data source
contains different class than the query was for.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDREC looking for record '%1/%2'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is looking up records of given name
and type in the database.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDREF looking for referral at '%1'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is identifying if this domain is
a referral and where it goes.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FINDREF_BAD_CLASS class mismatch looking for referral ('%1' and '%2')
The SQLite data source was trying to identify if there's a referral. But
it contains different class than the query was for.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FIND_BAD_CLASS class mismatch looking for an RRset ('%1' and '%2')
The SQLite data source was looking up an RRset, but the data source contains
different class than the query was for.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FIND_NSEC3 looking for NSEC3 in zone '%1' for hash '%2'
Debug information. We're trying to look up a NSEC3 record in the SQLite data
source.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_FIND_NSEC3_NO_ZONE no such zone '%1'
The SQLite data source was asked to provide a NSEC3 record for given zone.
But it doesn't contain that zone.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_INCOMPATIBLE_VERSION database schema V%1.%2 incompatible with version (V%3.%4) expected
The version of the SQLite3 database schema used to hold the zone data
is incompatible with the version expected by BIND 10.  As a result,
BIND 10 is unable to run using the database file as the data source.

The database should be updated using the means described in the BIND
10 documentation.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_NEWCONN SQLite3Database is being initialized
A wrapper object to hold database connection is being initialized.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_OPEN opening SQLite database '%1'
Debug information. The SQLite data source is loading an SQLite database in
the provided file.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_PREVIOUS looking for name previous to '%1'
This is a debug message.  The name given was not found, so the program
is searching for the next name higher up the hierarchy (e.g. if
www.example.com were queried for and not found, the software searches
for the "previous" name, example.com).

% DATASRC_SQLITE_PREVIOUS_NO_ZONE no zone containing '%1'
The name given was not found, so the program is searching for the next
name higher up the hierarchy (e.g. if www.example.com were queried
for and not found, the software searches for the "previous" name,
example.com). However, this name is not contained in any zone in the
data source. This is an error since it indicates a problem in the earlier
processing of the query.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_SETUP setting up new SQLite3 database in '%1'
The database for SQLite data source was found empty. It is assumed this is the
first run and it is being initialized with current schema.  It'll still contain
no data, but it will be ready for use. If this is indeed the first run of
BIND 10, it is to be expected and completely harmless. If you just configured
a data source to point to an existing file and you see this, you may have
misspelled the file name.

% DATASRC_SQLITE_SETUP_OLD_API setting up new SQLite database
The database for SQLite data source was found empty. It is assumed this is the
first run and it is being initialized with current schema.  It'll still contain
no data, but it will be ready for use. This is similar to DATASRC_SQLITE_SETUP
message, but it is logged from the old API. You should never see it, since the
API is deprecated.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_FAILED buffer4_receive callout failed: %1
This error message is issued when the callout for the buffer4_receive hook
point failed.  This may occur as a result of an internal server error.
The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_NOT_FOR_US %1: dropping query to be processed by another server
This debug message is issued when the received DHCPv4 query is dropped
by this server because it should be served by another server. This
is the case when the remote server was designated to process the packet
as a result of load balancing or because it is a primary server in the
hot standby configuration. The argument provides client identification
information retrieved from the query.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_PACKET_OPTIONS_SKIPPED an error upacking an option, caused subsequent options to be skipped: %1
A debug message issued when an option failed to unpack correctly, making it
impossible to unpack the remaining options in the DHCPv4 query. The server
will still attempt to service the packet. The sole argument provides a
reason for unpacking error.

% HA_BUFFER4_RECEIVE_UNPACK_FAILED failed to parse query from %1 to %2, received over interface %3, reason: %4
This debug message is issued when received DHCPv4 query is malformed and
can't be parsed by the buffer4_receive callout. The query will be
dropped by the server. The first three arguments specify source IP address,
destination IP address and the interface. The last argument provides a
reason for failure.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_FAILED buffer6_receive callout failed: %1
This error message is issued when the callout for the buffer6_receive hook
point failed. This may occur as a result of an internal server error.
The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_NOT_FOR_US %1: dropping query to be processed by another server
This debug message is issued when the received DHCPv6 query is dropped
by this server because it should be served by another server. This
is the case when the remote server was designated to process the packet
as a result of load balancing or because it is a primary server in the
hot standby configuration. The argument provides client identification
information retrieved from the query.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_PACKET_OPTIONS_SKIPPED an error upacking an option, caused subsequent options to be skipped: %1
A debug message issued when an option failed to unpack correctly, making it
impossible to unpack the remaining options in the DHCPv6 query. The server
will still attempt to service the packet. The sole argument provides a
reason for unpacking error.

% HA_BUFFER6_RECEIVE_UNPACK_FAILED failed to parse query from %1 to %2, received over interface %3, reason: %4
This debug message is issued when received DHCPv6 query is malformed and
can't be parsed by the buffer6_receive callout. The query will be
dropped by the server. The first three arguments specify source IP address,
destination IP address and the interface. The last argument provides a
reason for failure.

% HA_COMMAND_PROCESSED_FAILED command_processed callout failed: %1
This error message is issued when the callout for the command_processed hook
point failed. The argument contains a reason for the error.

% HA_CONFIGURATION_FAILED failed to configure High Availability hooks library: %1
This error message is issued when there is an error configuring the HA hooks
library. The argument provides the detailed error message.

% HA_CONFIGURATION_SUCCESSFUL HA hook library has been successfully configured
This informational message is issued when the HA hook library configuration
parser successfully parses and validates the new configuration.

% HA_CONFIG_AUTO_FAILOVER_DISABLED auto-failover disabled for %1
This warning message is issued to indicate that the 'auto-failover' parameter
was administratively disabled for the specified server. The server will not
automatically start serving partner's scope when the partner failure is detected.
The server administrator will need to enable this scope manually by
sending appropriate ha-scopes command.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_SYNCING_DISABLED lease database synchronization between HA servers is disabled
This warning message is issued when the lease database synchronization is
administratively disabled. This is valid configuration if the leases are
replicated between lease databases via some other mechanism, e.g. SQL
database replication.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_SYNCING_DISABLED_REMINDER bypassing SYNCING state because lease database synchronization is administratively disabled
This informational message is issued as a reminder that lease database
synchronization is administratively disabled and therefore the server
transitions directly from the "waiting" to "ready" state.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_AND_SYNCING_DIFFER unusual configuration where "send-lease-updates": %1 and "sync-leases": %2
This warning message is issued when the configuration values of the
send-lease-updates and sync-leases parameters differ. This may be a
valid configuration but is unusual. Normally, if the lease database
with replication is in use, both values are set to false. If a lease
database without replication is in use (e.g. memfile), both values
are set to true. Providing different values for those parameters means
that an administrator either wants the server to not synchronize
leases upon startup but later send lease updates to the partner, or
the lease database should be synchronized upon startup, but no lease
updates are later sent as a result of leases allocation.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_DISABLED lease updates will not be generated
This warning message is issued when the lease updates are administratively
disabled. This is valid configuration if the leases are replicated to the
partner's database via some other mechanism, e.g. SQL database replication.

% HA_CONFIG_LEASE_UPDATES_DISABLED_REMINDER lease updates are administratively disabled and will not be generated while in %1 state
This informational message is issued as a reminder that the lease updates
are administratively disabled and will not be issued in the HA state to
which the server has transitioned. The sole argument specifies the state
into which the server has transitioned.

This warning message indicates that a peer returned an error status code
in response to a heartbeat. This is the sign that the peer may not function
properly. The server will keep trying to send heartbeats until it considers
that communication is interrupted.

% HA_HEARTBEAT_HANDLER_FAILED heartbeat command failed: %1
This error message is issued to indicate that the heartbeat command handler
failed while processing the command. The argument provides the reason for
failure.

% HA_HIGH_CLOCK_SKEW partner's clock is %1, please synchronize clocks!
This warning message is issued when the clock skew between the active servers
exceeds 30 seconds. The HA service continues to operate but may not function
properly, especially for low lease lifetimes. The administrator should
should synchronize the clocks, e.g. using NTP. If the clock skew exceeds
60 seconds, the HA service will terminate.

% HA_HIGH_CLOCK_SKEW_CAUSES_TERMINATION partner's clock is %1, causing HA service to terminate
This warning message is issued when the clock skew between the active servers
exceeds 60 seconds. The HA service stops. The servers will continue to respond

/// @brief Utility class to manage bulk of leases in the lease files.
///
/// This class exposes methods which allow for bulk loading leases from
/// the lease file and dumping the leases held in memory into the
/// lease file. There are two major use cases for this class:
/// - load leases by the DHCP server when the server starts up or
///   reloads configuration,
/// - an application performing a lease file cleanup rewrites the whole
///   lease file to remove the redundant lease entries.
///
/// In the former case, this class is used by the @c MemFile_LeaseMgr.
/// In the latter case, this class is used by the standalone application
/// which reads the whole lease file into memory (storage) and then
/// dumps the leases held in the storage to another file.
///
/// The methods in this class are templated so as they can be used both
/// with the @c Lease4Storage and @c Lease6Storage to process the DHCPv4
/// and DHCPv6 leases respectively.
///

    /// them into the storage to which reference is specified as an
    /// argument. If there are multiple entries for the particular lease
    /// in the lease file the entries further in the lease file override
    /// the previous entries.

    /// means that the particular lease was released and the method
    /// removes an existing lease from the container.

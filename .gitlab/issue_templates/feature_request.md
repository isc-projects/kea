about: Suggest an idea for this project

---

**Some initial questions**
- Are you sure your feature is not already implemented in the latest Kea version?
- Are you sure what you would like to do is not possible using some other mechanisms?
- Have you discussed your idea on kea-users or kea-dev mailing lists?

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

**Describe the solution you'd like**

**Additional context**

**Funding its development**
Kea is run by ISC, which is a small non-profit organization without any government funding or any permanent sponsorship organizations. Are you able and willing to participate financially in the development costs?

**Participating in development**
Are you willing to participate in the feature development? ISC team always tries to make a feature as generic as possible, so it can be used in wide variety of situations. That means the proposed solution may be a bit different that you initially thought. Are you willing to take part in the design discussions? Are you willing to test an unreleased engineering code?

**Contacting you**
How can ISC reach you to discuss this matter further? If you do not specify any means such as e-mail, jabber id or a telephone, we may send you a message on github with questions when we have them.

	b10-auth now returns SERVFAIL to queries for a zone that is
	configured to be loaded in-memory but isn't due to load time

	b10-dhcp4: Added the ability for the server to respond to a
	directly connected client which does not yet have an IP address.
	On Linux, the server will unicast the response to the client's
	hardware address and the 'yiaddr' (the client's new IP
	address). Sending a response to the unicast address prevents other
	(not interested) hosts from receiving the server response. This
	capability is not yet implemented on non-Linux Operating Systems
	where, in all cases, the server responds to the broadcast
	address. The logic conforms to section 4.1 of RFC 2131.

	b10-cmdctl: fixed a hangup problem on receiving the shutdown
	command from bindctl.  Note, however, that cmdctl is defined as

	Worked around some unit test regressions on FreeBSD 9.1 due to
	a binary compatibility issue between standard and system
	libraries (http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=175453).
	While not all tests still pass, main BIND 10 programs should
	generally work correctly.  Still, there can be odd run time
	behavior such as abrupt crash instead of graceful shutdown
	when some fatal event happens, so it's generally discouraged to
	use BIND 10 on FreeBSD 9.1 RELEASE.  According to the above
	bug report for FreeBSD, it seems upgrading or downgrading the
	FreeBSD version will solve this problem.

	The "delete record" interface of the database based data source
	was extended so that the parameter includes reversed name in
	addition to the actual name.  This may help the underlying
	accessor implementation if reversed names are more convenient
	for the delete operation.  This was the case for the SQLite3
	accessor implementation, and it now performs delete operations
	much faster.  At a higher level, this means IXFR and DDNS Updates

	The separate "static" data source is now deprecated as it can be

	This means existing configuration may not work after an update.
	If "config show data_sources/classes/CH[0]" on bindctl contains a
	"static" type of data source, you'll need to update it as follows:
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/type MasterFiles
	> config set data_sources/classes/CH[0]/params {"BIND": =>
	  "<the value of current data_sources/classes/CH[0]/params>"}

	Added a chapter about the use of the bindctl command tool to
	to the BIND 10 guide.
	(Trac #2305, git c4b0294b5bf4a9d32fb18ab62ca572f492788d72)

506.	[security]		jinmei
	Fixed a use-after-free case in handling DNAME record with the
	in-memory data source.  This could lead to a crash of b10-auth
	if it serves a zone containing a DNAME RR from the in-memory
	data source.  This bug was introduced at bind10-devel-20120927.

504.	[bug]*		naokikambe
	Fixed an XML format viewed from b10-stats-httpd. Regarding
	per-zone counters as zones of Xfrout, a part of the item
	values wasn't an exact XML format. A zone name can be
	specified in URI as
	/bind10/statistics/xml/Xfrout/zones/example.org/xfrreqdone.
	XSD and XSL formats are also changed to constant ones due
	to these changes.

503.	[func]		Stephen
	Add initial version of a MySQL backend for the DHCP code.  This
	implements the basic IPv6 lease access functions - add lease, delete
	lease and update lease.  The backend is enabled by specifying
	--with-dhcp-mysql on the "configure" command line: without this
	switch, the MySQL code is not compiled, so leaving BIND 10 able to
	be built on systems without MySQL installed.
	(Trac #2342, git c7defffb89bd0f3fdd7ad2437c78950bcb86ad37)

	TTLs can be specified with units as well as number of seconds now.
	This allows specifications like "1D3H".

500.	[bug]		jinmei
	Corrected the autoconf example in the examples directory so it can
	use the configured path to Boost to check availability of the BIND 10
	library.  Previously the sample configure script could fail if
	Boost is installed in an uncommon place.  Also, it now provides a
	helper m4 function and example usage for embedding the library
	path to executable (using linker options like -Wl,-R) to help
	minimize post-build hassles.

	The b10-auth 'loadzone' command now uses the internal thread
	introduced in 495 to (re)load a zone in the background, so that
	query processing isn't blocked while loading a zone.
	(Trac #2213, git 686594e391c645279cc4a95e0e0020d1c01fba7e)

498.	[func]		marcin
	Implemented DHCPv6 option values configuration using configuration
	manager. In order to set values for data fields carried by the
	particular option, user specifies the string of hexadecimal digits
	that is in turn converted to binary data and stored into option
	buffer. More user friendly way of option content specification is
	planned.

497.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed several issues in isc-sysinfo:
	- make sure it doesn't report a negative value for free memory
	  size (this happened on FreeBSD, but can possibly occur on other
	  BSD variants)
	- correctly identifies the SMP support in kernel on FreeBSD
	- print more human readable uptime as well as the time in seconds
	(Trac #2297, git 59a449f506948e2371ffa87dcd19059388bd1657)

496.	[func]		tomek
	DHCPv6 Allocation Engine implemented. It allows address allocation
	from the configured subnets/pools. It currently features a single
	allocator: IterativeAllocator, which assigns addresses iteratively.
	Other allocators (hashed, random) are planned.
	(Trac #2324, git 8aa188a10298e3a55b725db36502a99d2a8d638a)

495.	[func]		team
	b10-auth now handles reconfiguration of data sources in
	background using a separate thread.  This means even if the new
	configuration includes a large amount of data to be loaded into
	memory (very large zones and/or a very large number of zones),
	the reconfiguration doesn't block query handling.
	(Multiple Trac tickets up to #2211)

494.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a problem that shutting down BIND 10 kept some of the
	processes alive.  It was two-fold: when the main bind10 process
	started as a root, started b10-sockcreator with the privilege, and
	then dropped the privilege, the bind10 process cannot kill the
	sockcreator via signal any more (when it has to), but it kept
	sending the signal and didn't stop.  Also, when running on Python
	3.1 (or older), the sockcreator had some additional file
	descriptor open, which prevented it from exiting even after the
	bind10 process terminated.  Now the bind10 process simply gives up
	killing a subprocess if it fails due to lack of permission, and it
	makes sure the socket creator is spawned without any unnecessary
	FDs open.
	(Trac #1858, git 405d85c8a0042ba807a3a123611ff383c4081ee1)

493.	[build]		jinmei
	Fixed build failure with newer versions of clang++.  These
	versions are stricter regarding "unused variable" and "unused
	(driver) arguments" warnings, and cause fatal build error
	with -Werror.  The affected versions of clang++ include Apple's
	customized version 4.1 included in Xcode 4.5.1.  So this fix
	will solve build errors for Mac OS X that uses newer versions of
	Xcode.

	b10-dhcp6: Configuration for DHCPv6 has been implemented.
	Currently it is possible to configure IPv6 subnets and pools
	within those subnets, global and per subnet values of renew,
	rebind, preferred and valid lifetimes. Configured parameters
	are accepted, but are not used yet by the allocation engine yet.

	The isc::dns::RRsetList class has been removed. It was now unused
	inside the BIND 10 codebase, and the interface was considered
	prone to misuse.
	(Trac #2266, git 532ac3d0054f6a11b91ee369964f3a84dabc6040)

488.	[build]		jinmei
	On configure, changed the search order for Python executable.
	It first tries more specific file names such as "python3.2" before
	more generic "python3".  This will prevent configure failure on
	Mac OS X that installs Python3 via recent versions of Homebrew.
	(Trac #2339, git 88db890d8d1c64de49be87f03c24a2021bcf63da)

487.	[bug]		jinmei
	The bind10 process now terminates a component (subprocess) by the
	"config remove Boss/components" bindctl command even if the
	process crashes immediately before the command is sent to bind10.
	Previously this led to an inconsistent state between the
	configuration and an internal component list of bind10, and bind10
	kept trying to restart the component.  A known specific case of
	this problem is that b10-ddns could keep failing (due to lack of
	dependency modules) and the administrator couldn't stop the
	restart via bindctl.
	(Trac #2244, git 7565788d06f216ab254008ffdfae16678bcd00e5)

486.	[bug]*		jinmei
	All public header files for libb10-dns++ are now installed.
	Template configure.ac and utility AC macros for external projects
	using the library are provided under the "examples" directory.
	The src/bin/host was moved as part of the examples (and not
	installed with other BIND 10 programs any more).

	Several bugs have been fixed in bindctl; tab-completion now works
	within configuration lists, the problem where sometimes the
	completion added a part twice has been solved, and it no longer
	suggests the confusing value 'argument' as a completion-hint for
	configuration items. Additionally, bindctl no longer crashes upon
	input like 'config remove Boss'.

	A new library (libb10-dhcpsrv) has been created. At present, it

483.	[func]		marcin
	libdhcp++: Added new parameter to define sub-second timeout
	for DHCP packet reception. The total timeout is now specified
	by two parameters:  first specifies integral number of
	seconds, second (which defaults to 0) specifies fractional
	seconds with microsecond resolution.
	(Trac #2231, git 15560cac16e4c52129322e3cb1787e0f47cf7850)

482.	[func]		team
	Memory footprint of the in-memory data source has been
	substantially improved.  For example, b10-auth now requires much
	less memory than BIND 9 named for loading and serving the same
	zone in-memory.  This is a transparent change in terms of user
	operation; there's no need to update or change the configuration
	to enable this feature.
	Notes: multiple instances of b10-auth still make separate copies
	of the memory image.  Also, loading zones in memory still suspends
	query processing, so manual reloading or reloading after incoming
	transfer may cause service disruption for huge zones.
	(Multiple Trac tickets, Summarized in Trac #2101)

	The UDP IPv6 packets are now correctly fragmented for maximum
	guaranteed MTU, so they won't get lost because being too large
	for some hop.
	(Trac #1534, git ff013364643f9bfa736b2d23fec39ac35872d6ad)

389.	[func]*		vorner
	Xfrout now uses the global TSIG keyring, instead of its own. This
	means the keys need to be set only once (in tsig_keys/keys).
	However, the old configuration of Xfrout/tsig_keys need to be
	removed for Xfrout to work.

386.	[bug]		jelte
	Upon initial sqlite3 database creation, the 'diffs' table is now
	always created. This already happened most of the time, but there
	are a few cases where it was skipped, resulting in potential errors
	in xfrout later.
	(Trac #1717, git 30d7686cb6e2fa64866c983e0cfb7b8fabedc7a2)

385.	[bug]		jinmei
	libdns++: masterLoad() didn't accept comments placed at the end of
	an RR.  Due to this the in-memory data source cannot load a master
	file for a signed zone even if it's preprocessed with BIND 9's
	named-compilezone.
	Note: this fix is considered temporary and still only accepts some
	limited form of such comments.  The main purpose is to allow the
	in-memory data source to load any signed or unsigned zone files as
	long as they are at least normalized with named-compilezone.

	b10-auth now also experimentally supports statistics counters of
	the rcode responses it sends. The counters can be shown as

379.	[bug]		jelte
	Configuration commands in bindctl now check for list indices if
	the 'identifier' argument points to a child element of a list
	item. Previously, it was possible to 'get' non-existent values
	by leaving out the index, e.g. "config show Auth/listen_on/port,
	which should be config show Auth/listen_on[<index>]/port, since
	Auth/listen_on is a list. The command without an index will now
	show an error. It is still possible to show/set the entire list
	("config show Auth/listen_on").

376.	[bug]		jinmei, vorner
	The new query handling module of b10-auth did not handle type DS
	query correctly: It didn't look for it in the parent zone, and
	it incorrectly returned a DS from the child zone if it
	happened to exist there.  Both were corrected, and it now also
	handles the case of having authority for the child and a grand
	ancestor.

375.	[func]		jelte
	Modules now inform the system when they are stopping. As a result,
	they are removed from the 'active modules' list in bindctl, which
	can then inform the user directly when it tries to send them a
	command or configuration update.  Previously this would result
	in a 'not responding' error instead of 'not running'.

	When the allocation of a socket fails for a different reason than the
	socket not being provided by the OS, the b10-auth and b10-resolver
	abort, as the system might be in inconsistent state after such error.
	(Trac #1543, git 49ac4659f15c443e483922bf9c4f2de982bae25d)

371.	[bug]		jelte
	The new query handling module of b10-auth (currently only used with
	the in-memory data source) now correctly includes the DS record (or
	the denial of its existence if NSEC is used) when returning a
	delegation from a signed zone.

	libdns++: a new class NSEC3Hash was introduced as a utility for
	calculating NSEC3 hashes for various purposes.  Python binding was

	implementation that empty salt in text representation was
	rejected.

	The SocketRequestor provides more information about what error
	happened when it throws, by using subclasses of the original

	still use the original exception, while it can be recognized if
	necessary.

368.	[func]*		jinmei
	libdatasrc: the interface of ZoneFinder() was changed: WILDCARD
	related result codes were deprecated and removed, and the
	corresponding information is now provided via a separate accessor
	method on FindResult.  Other separate FindResult methods will
	also tell the caller whether the zone is signed with NSEC or NSEC3
	(when necessary and applicable).

367.	[bug]		jinmei
	libdatasrc: in-memory data source could incorrectly reject to load
	zones containing RRSIG records.  For example, it didn't allow
	RRSIG that covers a CNAME RR.  This fix also makes sure find()
	will return RRsets with RRSIGs if they are signed.
	(Trac #1614, git e8241ea5a4adea1b42a60ee7f2c5cfb87301734c)

366.	[bug]		vorner
	Fixed problem where a directory named "io" conflicted with the python3
	standard module "io" and caused the installation to fail.  The
	offending directory has been renamed to "cio".

	b10-auth experimentally supports statistics counters of incoming
	requests per opcode.  The counters can be (e.g.) shown as
	opcode.<code name> in the output of the bindctl "Stats show"
	command, where <code name> is lower-cased textual representation
	of opcodes ("query", "notify", etc).
	Note: This is an experimental attempt of supporting more
	statistics counters for b10-auth, and the interface and output may
	change in future versions.

363.	[func]		jelte
	Added dummy DDNS module b10-ddns. Currently it does not
	provide any functionality, but it is a skeleton implementation
	that will be expanded later.
	(Trac #1451, git b0d0bf39fbdc29a7879315f9b8e6d602ef3afb1b)

362.	[func]*		vorner
	Due to the socket creator changes, b10-auth and b10-resolver
	are no longer needed to start as root. They are started as
	the user they should be running, so they no longer have
	the -u flag for switching the user after initialization.
	Note: this change broke backward compatibility to boss component
	configuration.  If your b10-config.db contains "setuid" for
	Boss.components, you'll need to remove that entry by hand before
	starting BIND 10.

361.	[func]		vorner, jelte, jinmei
	The socket creator is now used to provide sockets. It means you can
	reconfigure the ports and addresses at runtime even when the rest
	of the bind10 runs as non root user.

359.	[bug]		kevin
	Corrected SOA serial check in xfrout.  It now compares the SOA
	serial of an IXFR query with that of the server based serial
	number arithmetic, and replies with a single SOA record of the
	server's current version if the former is equal to or newer
	than the latter.
	(Trac #1462, git ceeb87f6d539c413ebdc66e4cf718e7eb8559c45)

358.	[bug]		jinmei
	b10-resolver ignored default configuration parameters if listen_on
	failed (this can easily happen especially for a test environment
	where the run time user doesn't have root privilege), and even if
	listen_on was updated later the resolver wouldn't work correctly
	unless it's fully restarted (for example, all queries would be
	rejected due to an empty ACL).

357.	[bug]		jinmei
	ZoneFinder::find() for database based data sources didn't
	correctly identify out-of-zone query name and could return a
	confusing result such as NXRRSET.  It now returns NXDOMAIN with an
	empty RRset.  Note: we should rather throw an exception in such a
	case, which should be revisited later (see Trac #1536).

	Python xfrin.diff module incorrectly combined RRSIGs of different

	libdhcp++: Transmission and reception of DHCPv4 packets is now
	implemented. Low-level hacks are not implemented for transmission

	Alpha version of DHCP benchmarking tool added.  "perfdhcp" is able to
	test both IPv4 and IPv6 servers: it can time the four-packet exchange

	Fixed a bug where adding Zonemgr/secondary_zones without explicitly
	setting the class value of the added zone resulted in a cryptic
	error in bindctl ("Error: class"). It will now correctly default to

	The DataSourceClientContainer class that dynamically loads
	datasource backend libraries no longer provides just a .so file name
	to its call to dlopen(), but passes it an absolute path. This means
	that it is no longer an system implementation detail that depends on
	[DY]LD_LIBRARY_PATH which file is chosen, should there be multiple
	options (for instance, when test-running a new build while a
	different version is installed).
	These loadable libraries are also no longer installed in the default
	library path, but in a subdirectory of the libexec directory of the
	target ($prefix/libexec/[version]/backends).
	This also removes the need to handle b10-xfin and b10-xfrout as
	'special' hardcoded components, and they are now started as regular
	components as dictated by the configuration of the boss process.

	b10-xfrout could potentially create an overflow response message
	(exceeding the 64KB max) or could create unnecessarily small

	b10-xfrout: ACLs for xfrout can now be configured per zone basis.
	A per zone ACL is part of a more general zone configuration.  A

	> config add Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl
	> config set Xfrout/zone_config[0]/transfer_acl[0] {"action": "REJECT"}
	The previous global ACL (query_acl) was renamed to transfer_acl,

	b10-resolver: Introduced ACL on incoming queries.  By default the
	resolver accepts queries from ::1 and 127.0.0.1 and rejects all
	others.  The ACL can be configured with bindctl via the
	"Resolver/query_acl" parameter.  For example, to accept queries
	from 192.0.2.0/24 (in addition to the default list), do this:
	> config add Resolver/query_acl
	> config set Resolver/query_acl[2]/action "ACCEPT"

	Resolved that the stats module wasn't configurable in bindctl in
	spite of its having configuration items. The configuration part
	was removed from the original spec file "stats.spec" and was
	placed in a new spec file "stats-schema.spec". Because it means
	definitions of statistics items. The command part is still
	there. Thus stats module currently has no its own configuration,
	and the items in "stats-schema.spec" are neither visible nor
	configurable through bindctl. "stats-schema.spec" is shared with
	stats module and stats-httpd module, and maybe with other
	statistical modules in future. "stats.spec" has own configuration
	and commands of stats module, if it requires.

	Introduced a workaround for clang++ build on FreeBSD (and probably
	some other OSes).  If building BIND 10 fails with clang++ due to
	a link error about "__dso_handle", try again from the configure
	script with CXX_LIBTOOL_LDFLAGS=-L/usr/lib (the path actually
	doesn't matter; the important part is the -L flag).  This
	workaround is not automatically enabled as it's difficult to
	detect the need for it dynamically, and must be enabled via the
	variable by hand.
	(Trac #474, git cfde436fbd7ddf3f49cbbd153999656e8ca2a298)

	b10-auth: updated query benchmark so that it can test in memory
	data source.  Also fixed a bug that the output buffer isn't
	cleared after query processing, resulting in misleading results
	or program crash.  This is a regression due to change #135.
	(Trac #465, svn r4103)

	b10-auth: Fixed a bug that the authoritative server includes
	trailing garbage data in responses.  This is a regression due to
	change #135. (Trac #462, svn r4081)

140.	[func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:
	  ... "auth.queries.tcp": 1, "auth.queries.udp": 1 ...
	Using the "Auth sendstats" command you can make b10-auth send the
	counters to b10-stats immediately.
	(Trac #347, svn r4026)

139.	[build]		jreed
	Introduced configure option and make targets for generating
	Python code coverage report. This adds new make targets:
	report-python-coverage and clean-python-coverage. The C++
	code coverage targets were renamed to clean-cpp-coverage
	and report-cpp-coverage. (Trac #362, svn r4023)

138.	[func]*		jinmei
	b10-auth: added a configuration interface to support in memory
	data sources.  For example, the following command to bindctl
	will configure a memory data source containing the "example.com"
	zone with the zone file named "example.com.zone":
	> config set Auth/datasources/ [{"type": "memory", "zones": \
	 [{"origin": "example.com", "file": "example.com.zone"}]}]
	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be
	configured explicitly.  To disable it again, specify a null list
	for Auth/datasources:
	> config set Auth/datasources/ []
	Notes: it's currently for class IN only.  The zone files are not
	actually loaded into memory yet (which will soon be implemented).
	This is an experimental feature and the syntax may change in
	future versions.

	accepts 'unknown' data; i.e. data for modules that it does not know
	about, or configuration items that are not specified in the .spec
	files.

	Add b10-resolver. This is an example recursive server that
	currently does forwarding only and no caching.
	(Trac #327, svn r3903)

134.	[func]		vorner
	b10-resolver supports timeouts and retries in forwarder mode.
	(Trac #401, svn r3660)

133.	[func]		vorner
	New temporary logging function available in isc::log. It is used by
	b10-resolver.
	(Trac #393, r3602)

132.	[func]		vorner
	The b10-resolver is configured through config manager.
	It has "listen_on" and "forward_addresses" options.
	(Trac #389, r3448)

131.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced two template classes RBTree and RBNode
	to provide the generic map with domain name as key and anything as
	the value. Because of some unresolved design issue, the new classes
	are only intended to be used by memory zone and zone table.
	(Trac #397, svn r3890)

130.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced a new class MemoryDataSrc to provide
	the general interface for memory data source.  For the initial
	implementation, we don't make it a derived class of AbstractDataSrc
	because the interface is so different (we'll eventually
	consider this as part of the generalization work).
	(Trac #422, svn r3866)

129.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added new functions masterLoad() for loading master
	zone files.  The initial implementation can only parse a limited
	form of master files, but BIND 9's named-compilezone can convert
	any valid zone file into the acceptable form.
	(Trac #423, svn r3857)

128.	[build]		vorner
	Test for query name = '.', type = DS to authoritative nameserver

	contacted.
	(Trac #356, Trac #408, svn r3823)

bind10-devel-20101201 released on December 01, 2010

125.	[func]		jelte
	Added support for addressing individual list items in bindctl
	configuration commands; If you have an element that is a list, you
	can use foo[X]		integer
	(starting at 0)
	(Trac #405, svn r3739)

124.	[bug]		jreed
	Fix some wrong version reporting. Now also show the version
	for the component and BIND 10 suite. (Trac #302, svn r3696)

123.	[bug]		jelte
	src/bin/bindctl printed values had the form of python literals
	(e.g. 'True'), while the input requires valid JSON (e.g. 'true').
	Output changed to JSON format for consistency. (svn r3694)

122.	[func]		stephen
	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

121.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is
	not much of real use, however, because no protocol support was
	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

120.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

117.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the
	support of in memory data source.  This is an intermediate step to
	the bigger feature, and is not yet actually usable in practice.
	(Trac #399, svn r3590)

116.	[bug]		jerry
	src/bin/xfrout: Xfrout and Auth will communicate by long tcp
	connection, Auth needs to make a new connection only on the first
	time or if an error occurred.
	(Trac #299, svn r3482)

115.	[func]*		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Changed DNS message flags and section names from
	separate classes to simpler enums, considering the balance between
	type safety and usability.  API has been changed accordingly.
	More documentation and tests were provided with these changes.
	(Trac #358, r3439)

114.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported clang++.  Note: Boost >= 1.44 is required.
	(Trac #365, svn r3383)

113.	[func]*		zhanglikun
	Folder name 'utils'(the folder in /src/lib/python/isc/) has been
	renamed	to 'util'. Programs that used 'import isc.utils.process'
	now need to use 'import isc.util.process'. The folder
	/src/lib/python/isc/Util is removed since it isn't used by any
	program. (Trac #364, r3382)

112.	[func]		zhang likun
	Add one mixin class to override the naive serve_forever() provided
	in python library socketserver. Instead of polling for shutdown
	every poll_interval seconds, one socketpair is used to wake up
	the waiting server. (Trac #352, svn r3366)

111.	[bug]*		Vaner
	Make sure process xfrin/xfrout/zonemgr/cmdctl can be stopped
	properly when user enter "ctrl+c" or 'Boss shutdown' command
	through bindctl.  The ZonemgrRefresh.run_timer and
	NotifyOut.dispatcher spawn a thread themselves.
	(Trac #335, svn r3273)

110.	[func]		Vaner
	Added isc.net.check module to check ip addresses and ports for
	correctness and isc.net.addr to hold IP address. The bind10, xfrin
	and cmdctl programs are modified to use it.
	(Trac #353, svn r3240)

109.	[func]		naokikambe
	Added the initial version of the stats module for the statistics
	feature of BIND 10, which supports the restricted features and
	items and reports via bindctl command. (Trac #191, r3218)
	Added the document of the stats module, which is about how stats
	module collects the data (Trac #170, [wiki:StatsModule])

108.	[func]		jerry
	src/bin/zonemgr: Provide customizable configurations for
	lowerbound_refresh, lowerbound_retry, max_transfer_timeout and
	jitter_scope. (Trac #340, r3205)

	lib/python/isc/log: Fixed an issue with python logging,
	python log shouldn't die with OSError. (Trac #267, r3137)

102.	[build]		jinmei
	Disable threads in ASIO to minimize build time dependency.
	(Trac #345, r3100)

101.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Completed Opcode and Rcode implementation with more
	tests and documentation.  API is mostly the same but the
	validation was a bit tightened. (Trac #351, svn r3056)

100.	[func]		Vaner
	Python processes: support naming of python processes so
	they're not all called python3.
	(Trac #322, svn r3052)

99.	[func]*		jinmei
	Introduced a separate EDNS class to encapsulate EDNS related
	information more cleanly.  The related APIs are changed a bit,
	although it won't affect most of higher level applications.
	(Trac #311, svn r3020)

98.	[build]		jinmei
	The ./configure script now tries to search some common include
	paths for boost header files to minimize the need for explicit
	configuration with --with-boost-include. (Trac #323, svn r3006)

97.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a micro benchmark test for query processing of b10-auth.
	(Trac #308, svn r2982)

96.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed two small issues with configure: Do not set CXXFLAGS so that
	it can be customized; Make sure --disable-static works.
	(Trac #325, r2976)

bind10-devel-20100917 released on September 17, 2010

95.	[doc]		jreed
	Add b10-zonemgr manual page. Update other docs to introduce
	this secondary manager. (Trac #341, svn r2951)

95.	[bug]		jreed
	bin/xfrout and bin/zonemgr: Fixed some stderr output.
	(Trac #342, svn r2949)

94.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/xfrout:  Fixed a problem in xfrout where only 2 or 3 RRs
	were used per DNS message in the xfrout stream.
	(Trac #334, r2931)

93.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: A DS query could crash the library (and therefore,
	e.g. the authoritative server) if some RR of the same apex name
	is stored in the hot spot cache. (Trac #307, svn r2923)

92.	[func]*		jelte
	libdns_python (the python wrappers for libdns++) has been renamed
	to pydnspp (Python DNS++). Programs and libraries that used
	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

88.	[func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

87.	[func]		zhanglikun
	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one
	of the co-operating processes of BIND 10, which keeps track of
	timers and other information necessary for BIND 10 to act as a
	slave. (Trac #215, svn r2737)

85.	[build]*		jinmei
	Build programs using dynamic link by default.  A new configure
	option --enable-static-link is provided to force static link for
	executable programs.  Statically linked programs can be run on a
	debugger more easily and would be convenient for developers.
	(Trac #309, svn r2723)

bind10-devel-20100812 released on August 12, 2010

84.	[bug]		jinmei, jerry
	This is a quick fix patch for the issue: AXFR fails half the
	time because of connection problems. xfrout client will make
	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

83.	[build]*		jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

82.	[func]		jinmei
	bin/auth: Added -u option to change the effective process user
	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

81.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a C++ framework for micro benchmark tests.  A supplemental
	library functions to build query data for the tests were also
	provided. (Trac #241, svn r2664)

80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or
	non-running modules (for the latter, this is until we have a
	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's
	already running (listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

73.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

71.	[func]		each
	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

70.	[func]		each
	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

69.	[func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

68.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c (--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file',
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

67.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

66.	[bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)

65.	[func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

64.	[func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

63.	[func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

62.	[func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

61.	[bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc, bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Trac #136, svn r2147)

54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(),
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process,
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't
	be removed, exit from python.

	to find spec files in build tree when ran from source.
	(Trac #223)

50.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

39.	[func]*		each
	Renamed libauth to libdatasrc.

38.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	Send command 'shutdown' to Xfrin and Xfrout when boss receive SIGINT.

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation. This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix. This is no different than a general bug
	fix except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause
	security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

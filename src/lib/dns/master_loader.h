    ///

    ///
    /// Except for the exceptions listed below, the constructor doesn't
    /// throw. Most errors (like non-existent master file) are reported
    /// by the callbacks during load() or loadIncremental().
    ///
    /// \param master_file Path to the file to load.
    /// \param zone_origin The origin of zone to be expected inside
    ///     the master file. Currently unused, but it is expected to
    ///     be used for some validation.
    /// \param zone_class The class of zone to be expected inside the
    ///     master file.
    /// \param callbacks The callbacks by which it should report problems.
    ///     Usually, the callback carries a filename and line number of the
    ///     input where the problem happens. There's a special case of empty
    ///     filename and zero line in case the opening of the top-level master
    ///     file fails.
    /// \param add_callback The callback which would be called with each
    ///     loaded RR.
    /// \param options Options for the parsing, which is bitwise-or of
    ///     the Options values or DEFAULT. If the MANY_ERRORS option is
    ///     included, the parser tries to continue past errors. If it
    ///     is not included, it stops at first encountered error.
    /// \throw std::bad_alloc when there's not enough memory.
    /// \throw isc::InvalidParameter if add_callback is empty.

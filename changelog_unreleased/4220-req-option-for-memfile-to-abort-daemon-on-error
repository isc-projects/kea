[func]		tmark
	Memfile lease back end now supports the ``on-fail``
	parameter though without retry.  When set to either
	 ``stop-retry-exit`` or ``serve-retry-exit`` the
	server will exit on unrecoverable write errors. If
	 set to ``serve-retry-continue`` the server will
	continue to run but write errors will continue until
	corrective action is taken. Applies to both
	kea-dhcp4 and kea-dhcp6.

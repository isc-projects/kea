///
/// \brief The \c MessageRenderer class encapsulates implementation details
/// of rendering a DNS message into a buffer in wire format.
///
/// In effect, it's simply responsible for name compression at least in the
/// current implementation.  A \c MessageRenderer class object manages the
/// positions of names rendered in a buffer and uses that information to render
/// subsequent names with compression.
///
/// This class is mainly intended to be used as a helper for a more
/// comprehensive \c Message class internally; normal applications won't have
/// to care about this class.
///
/// A \c MessageRenderer class object is constructed with a \c OutputBuffer
/// object, which is the buffer into which the rendered %data will be written.
/// Normally the buffer is expected to be empty on construction, but it doesn't
/// have to be so; the \c MessageRenderer object will start rendering from the
/// end of the buffer at the time of construction.  However, if the
/// pre-existing portion of the buffer contains DNS names, these names won't
/// be considered for name compression.
///
/// Once a \c MessageRenderer object is constructed with a buffer, it is
/// generally expected that all rendering operations are performed via the
/// \c MessageRenderer object.  If the application modifies the buffer in
/// parallel with the \c MessageRenderer, the result will be undefined.
///
/// Note to developers: we introduced a separate class for name compression
/// because previous benchmark with BIND9 showed compression affects overall
/// response performance very much.  By having a separate class dedicated for
/// this purpose, we'll be able to change the internal implementation of name
/// compression in the future without affecting other part of the API and
/// implementation.  For the same reason, we adopt the "pimpl" idiom in the
/// class definition (i.e., using a pointer to a \c MessageRendererImpl class,
/// which is defined with the class implementation, not in the header file):
/// we may want to modify the compression implementation without modifying the
/// header file thereby requesting rebuild the package.
///
/// Furthermore, we may eventually want to allow other developers to develop
/// and use their own compression implementation.  Should such a case become
/// realistic, we may want to make the \c MessageRendererImpl class an abstract
/// base class and let concrete derived classes have their own implementations.
/// At the moment we don't the strong need for it, so we rather avoid over
/// abstraction and keep the definition simpler.

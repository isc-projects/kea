/// @file ncr_udp.h
/// @brief This file provides UDP socket based implementation for sending and
/// receiving NameChangeRequests
///
/// These classes are derived from the abstract classes, NameChangeListener
/// and NameChangeSender (see ncr_io.h).
///
/// The following discussion will refer to three layers of communications:
///
///    * Application layer - This is the business layer which needs to
///    transport NameChangeRequests, and is unaware of the means by which
///    they are transported.
///
///    * IO layer - This is the low-level layer that is directly responsible
///    for sending and receiving data asynchronously and is supplied through
///    other libraries.  This layer is largely unaware of the nature of the
///    data being transmitted.  In other words, it doesn't know beans about
///    NCRs.
///
///    * NameChangeRequest layer - This is the layer which acts as the
///    intermediary between the Application layer and the IO layer.  It must
///    be able to move NameChangeRequests to the IO layer as raw data and move
///    raw data from the IO layer in the Application layer as
///    NameChangeRequests.
///
/// This file defines NameChangeUDPListener class for receiving NCRs, and
/// NameChangeUDPSender for sending NCRs.
///
/// Both the listener and sender implementations utilize the same underlying
/// construct to move NCRs to and from a UDP socket. This construct consists
/// of a set of classes centered around isc::asiolink::UDPSocket.  UDPSocket
/// is a templated class that supports asio asynchronous event processing; and
/// which accepts as its parameter, the name of a callback class.
///
/// The asynchronous services provided by UDPSocket typically accept a buffer
/// for transferring data (either in or out depending on the service direction)
/// and an object which supplies a callback to invoke upon completion of the
/// service.
///
/// The callback class must provide an operator() with the following signature:
/// @code
///    void operator ()(const asio::error_code error_code,
///                     const size_t bytes_transferred);
/// @endcode
///
/// Upon completion of the service, the callback instance's operator() is
/// invoked by the aiso layer.  It is given both a outcome result and the
/// number of bytes either read or written, to or from the buffer supplied
/// to the service.
///
/// Typically, an asiolink based implementation would simply implement the
/// callback operator directly.  However, the nature of the asiolink library
/// is such that the callback object may be copied several times during course
/// of a service invocation.  This implies that any class being used as a
/// callback class must be copyable.  This is not always desirable.  In order
/// to separate the callback class from the NameChangeRequest, the construct
/// defines the UDPCallback class for use as a copyable, callback object.
///
/// The UDPCallback class provides the asiolink layer callback operator(),
/// which is invoked by the asiolink layer upon service completion.  It
/// contains:
///    * a pointer to the transfer buffer
///    * the capacity of the transfer buffer
///    * a IO layer outcome result
///    * the number of bytes transferred
///    * a method pointer to a NameChangeRequest layer completion handler
///
/// This last item, is critical. It points to an instance method that
/// will be invoked by the UDPCallback operator.  This provides access to
/// the outcome of the service call to the NameChangeRequest layer without
/// that layer being used as the actual callback object.
///
/// The completion handler method signature is codified in the typedef,
/// UDPCompletionHandler, and must be as follows:
///
/// @code
///     void(const bool, const UDPCallback*)
/// @endcode
///
/// Note that is accepts two parameters.  The first is a boolean indicator
/// which indicates if the service call completed successfully or not.  The
/// second is a pointer to the callback object invoked by the IOService upon
/// completion of the service.  The callback instance will contain all of the
/// pertinent information about the invocation and outcome of the service.
///
/// Using the contents of the callback, it is the responsibility of the
/// UDPCompletionHandler to interpret the results of the service invocation and
/// pass the interpretation to the application layer via either
/// NameChangeListener::invokeRecvHandler in the case of the UDP listener, or
/// NameChangeSender::invokeSendHandler in the case of UDP sender.

dnl @synopsis AX_BOOST_FOR_BIND10
dnl
dnl Test for the Boost C++ header files intended to be used within BIND 10
dnl
dnl If no path to the installed boost header files is given via the
dnl --with-boost-include option,  the macro searchs under
dnl /usr/local /usr/pkg /opt /opt/local directories.
dnl If it cannot detect any workable path for Boost, this macro treats it
dnl as a fatal error (so it cannot be called if the availability of Boost
dnl is optional).
dnl
dnl This macro also tries to identify some known portability issues, and
dnl sets corresponding variables so the caller can react to (or ignore,
dnl depending on other configuration) specific issues appropriately.
dnl
dnl This macro calls:
dnl
dnl   AC_SUBST(BOOST_INCLUDES)
dnl
dnl And possibly sets:
dnl   CPPFLAGS_BOOST_THREADCONF should be added to CPPFLAGS by caller
dnl   BOOST_OFFSET_PTR_WOULDFAIL set to "yes" if offset_ptr would cause build
dnl                              error; otherwise set to "no"
dnl   BOOST_NUMERIC_CAST_WOULDFAIL set to "yes" if numeric_cast would cause
dnl                                build error; otherwise set to "no"
dnl   BOOST_MAPPED_FILE_WOULDFAIL set to "yes" if managed_mapped_file would
dnl                               cause build failure; otherwise set to "no"
dnl   BOOST_MAPPED_FILE_CXXFLAG set to the compiler flag that would need to
dnl                             compile managed_mapped_file (can be empty).
dnl                             It is of no use if "WOULDFAIL" is yes.
dnl   BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT_WOULDFAIL set to "yes" if BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT would
dnl                                 cause build error; otherwise set to "no"

dnl   BOOST_OFFSET_PTR_OLD set to "yes" if the version of boost is older than
dnl                        1.48. Older versions of boost have a bug which
dnl                        causes segfaults in offset_ptr implementation when
dnl                        compiled by GCC with optimisations enabled.
dnl                        See ticket no. 3025 for details.

# This is the source of the set of messages generated by the message and
# logging components.  The associated .h and .cc files are created by hand from
# this file though and are not built during the build process; this is to avoid
# the chicken-and-egg situation where we need the files to build the message
# compiler, yet we need the compiler to build the files.

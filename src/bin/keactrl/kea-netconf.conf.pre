// This is just a very basic configuration. Kea comes with large suite (over 30)

// those materials to get better understanding of what this software is able to
// do. Comments in this configuration file sometimes refer to sections for more
// details. These are section numbers in Kea User's Guide. The version matching
// your software should come with your Kea package, but it is also available
// in ISC's Knowledgebase
// (https://kea.readthedocs.io;
// the direct link for the stable version is
// https://kea.readthedocs.io/).

// This configuration file contains only Netconf's configuration.
// If configurations for other Kea services are also included in this file they

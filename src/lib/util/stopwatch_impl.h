/// test behavior of the @c Stopwatch class without a need to rely on the system
/// clock. The @c StopwatchImpl API allows for overriding the @c getCurrentTime
/// method to return the arbitrary time value as current time to various
/// methods. By setting the current time to arbitrary values the test can expect
/// arbitrary values being returned by the class methods.

/// Also, by using the pimpl idiom the @c Stopwatch class hides its implementation
/// details and leaves the header with only the pointer to the @c StopwatchImpl
/// class.

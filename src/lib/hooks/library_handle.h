/// @brief Library handle
///
/// This class is accessed by the user library when registering callouts,
/// either by the library's load() function, or by one of the callouts
/// themselves.
///
/// It is really little more than a shell around the CalloutManager.  By
/// presenting this object to the user-library callouts, callouts can manage
/// the callout list for their own library, but cannot affect the callouts
/// registered by other libraries.
///
/// (This restriction is achieved by the CalloutManager maintaining the concept
/// of the "current library".  When a callout is registered - either by the
/// library's load() function, or by a callout in the library - the registration
/// information includes the library active at the time.  When that callout is
/// called, the CalloutManager uses that information to set the "current
/// library": the registration functions only operator on data whose
/// associated library is equal to the "current library".)

    /// @param index Index of the library to which the LibraryHandle applies.

    ///        is set as the current index, the registration call is made, and
    ///        the CalloutManager's library index is reset.  Note: although -1
    ///        is a valid argument value for

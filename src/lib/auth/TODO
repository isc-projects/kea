- change filenames so we don't have everything starting with "data_source_"?
- store rdata in the database as binary blobs instead of text
- correct NSEC3 logic:
  - closest encloser proof is incorrect; need to send covering NSEC3
    for the "next closest" name, not necessarily for the name itself
  - need to check for duplication in the resulting NSEC3's

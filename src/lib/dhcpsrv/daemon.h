/// @brief Base class for all services
///
/// This is the base class that all daemons (DHCPv4, DHCPv6, D2 and possibly
/// others) are derived from. It provides a standard interface for starting up,
/// reconfiguring, shutting down and several other operations. It also covers
/// some common operations.
///
/// This class is not expected to be instantiated directly, but rather daemon
/// implementations should derive from it.
///
/// Methods are not pure virtual, as we need to instantiate basic daemons (e.g.
/// Dhcpv6Srv) in tests, without going through the hassles of implemeting stub
/// methods.
///
/// This class comprises a static object holding a location of the configuration
/// file. The object must be static because it is instantiated by the signal
/// handler functions, which are static by their nature. The signal handlers
/// are used to reconfigure a running server and they need access to the
/// configuration file location. They get this access by calling
/// @c Daemon::getConfigFile function.
///
/// By default, the configuration file location is empty and its actual value
/// is assigned to the static object in @c Daemon::init function.
///
/// Classes derived from @c Daemon may install custom signal handlers using
/// @c isc::util::SignalSet class. This base class provides a declaration
/// of the @c SignalSet object that should be initialized in the derived
/// classes to install the custom exception handlers.
///
/// @note Only one instance of this class is instantiated as it encompasses
///       the whole operation of the server.  Nothing, however, enforces the
///       singleton status of the object.

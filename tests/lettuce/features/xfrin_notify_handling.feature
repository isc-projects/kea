Feature: Xfrin incoming notify handling
    Tests for Xfrin incoming notify handling. They also test
    statistics counters incremented, which are related to notifying
    and transferring by Xfrout and receiveing by Xfrin. Some cases are
    considered: Transferring is done via IPv4 or IPv6 transport. A
    transfer request from Xfrin is rejected by Xfrout. The master
    server or slave server is unreachable.

    Scenario: Handle incoming notify
    Given I have bind10 running with configuration xfrin/retransfer_master.conf with cmdctl port 47804 as master
    And wait for master stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
    And wait for master stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message XFROUT_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message ZONEMGR_STARTED
    And wait for master stderr message STATS_STARTING

    And I have bind10 running with configuration xfrin/retransfer_slave_notify.conf
    And wait for bind10 stderr message BIND10_STARTED_CC
    And wait for bind10 stderr message CMDCTL_STARTED
    And wait for bind10 stderr message AUTH_SERVER_STARTED
    And wait for bind10 stderr message XFRIN_STARTED
    And wait for bind10 stderr message ZONEMGR_STARTED

    # Note: .Xfrout.socket.unixdomain.open can be either expected to
    # be 0 or 1 here.  The reason is: if b10-xfrout has started up and is
    # ready for a request from b10-stats, then b10-stats does request
    # to b10-xfrout and the value results in 1. Otherwise if
    # b10-xfrout is starting and isn't yet ready, then b10-stats
    # doesn't request to b10-xfrout and the value still remains to be the
    # default value(0).

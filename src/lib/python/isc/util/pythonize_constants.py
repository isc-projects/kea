This script takes a C++ file with constants and converts it to a python
module. However, the syntax it parses is very limited (it doesn't understand
C++ at all, it just looks for lines containing the equal sign and strips
what it thinks might be type).

The purpose is to keep the same values of constants in C++ and python. This
saves the work of keeping the constants in sync manually and is less error
prone.

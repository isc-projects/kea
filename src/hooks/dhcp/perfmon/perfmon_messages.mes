% PERFMON_ALARM_CLEARED Alarm for %1 has been cleared, reported mean duration %2 is now below low-water-ms: %3
This info message is emitted when the reported mean duration for
an alarm that has been triggered has fallen below the value of its
low-water-ms parameter. The arguments detail the alarm's key and
the most recently reported mean.

% PERFMON_ALARM_TRIGGERED Alarm for %1 has been triggered since %2, reported mean duration %3 exceeds high-water-ms: %4
This warning message is emitted when the reported mean duration for
an alarm exceeds its high-water-ms value.  As long as the reported
averges remain above the low-water-ms value, the alarm will remain
triggered and this message will be repeated every alarm-report-secs.
Arguments detail the alarm's key, the time the alarm was first
triggered, the most recent reported mean, and the high-water-ms
value.

% PERFMON_CMDS_CONTROL_ERROR perfmon-control command processing failed: %1
This error message is issued when the PerfMon hook library encounters an
error processing a perfmon-control command.  The argument explains the
command error.

% PERFMON_CMDS_CONTROL_OK perfmon-control command success: active monitoring: %1, stats-mgr-reporting: %2
This info log is issued when perfmon-control command has successfully
enabled/disabled active monitoring and/or statistics mgr reporting.
Arguments reflect the current state of both.

% PERFMON_CMDS_GET_ALL_DURATIONS_ERROR perfmon-get-all-durations command processing failed: %1
This error message is issued when the PerfMon hook library encounters an
error processing a perfmon-get-all-durations command.  The argument explains the
command error.

% PERFMON_CMDS_GET_ALL_DURATIONS_OK perfmon-get-all-durations returning %1 durations
This info log is issued when perfmon-get-all-durations command has
completed successfully.  The argument contains the number of
durations returned.

% PERFMON_DEINIT_OK unloading PerfMon hooks library successful
This info message indicates that the PerfMon hooks library has been
removed successfully.

% PERFMON_DHCP4_PKT_EVENTS query: %1 events=[%2]
Logged at debug log level 50.
This debug message is emitted after an inbound DHCPv4 query has been
processed, the arguments are the query label and the dump of the
query's packet event stack.

% PERFMON_DHCP4_PKT_PROCESS_ERROR Packet event stack was not processed for query %1, reason %2
Logged at debug log level 50.
This debug message is emitted when the query's event stack could not
be processed. This is most likely a programmatic error and should be
reported.  The arguments identify the query and the reason it could
not be processed.  These errors should not affect server's normal
operations.

% PERFMON_DHCP4_SOCKET_RECEIVED_TIME_SUPPORT Kernel supports socket received time? %1
Logged at debug log level 40.
This debug message is emitted after a (re)configuration and indicates
whether or not the packet filter being used by kea-dhcp4 can supply
the timestamp a packet was received by the kernel for recording
SOCKET_RECEIVED events. If it does not, perfmon will still function but
will not have data available to determine kernel buffer wait times.

% PERFMON_DHCP6_PKT_EVENTS query: %1 events=[%2]
Logged at debug log level 50.
The debug message is emitted after an inbound DHCPv6 query has been
processed, the arguments are the query label and the dump of the
query's packet event stack.

% PERFMON_DHCP6_PKT_PROCESS_ERROR Packet event stack was not processed for query %1, reason %2
Logged at debug log level 50.

be processed. This is most likely a programmatic error and should be
reported.  The arguments identify the query and the reason it could

This debug message is emitted after a (re)configuration and indicates
whether or not the packet filter being used by kea-dhcp6 can supply
the timestamp a packet was received by the kernel for recording
SOCKET_RECEIVED events. If it does not, perfmon will still function but
will not have data available to determine kernel buffer wait times.

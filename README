This is the source for a pre-alpha version of BIND 10.

BUILDING

Simple build instructions:

  autoreconf --install
  ./configure
  make

Requires autoconf 2.59 or newer.

Use automake-1.11 or better for working Python 3.1 tests.

Operating-System specific tips:

- FreeBSD
  You may need to install a python binding for sqlite3 by hand.  A
  sample procedure is as follows:
  - add the following to /etc/make.conf
    PYTHON_VERSION=3.1
  - build and install the python binding from ports, assuming the top
    directory of the ports system is /usr/ports
  % cd /usr/ports/databases/py-sqlite3/
  % make
  % sudo make install

INSTALLATION

Install with:

  make install

Testing samples of a RSA key, certificate, and user account
are installed under the $PREFIX/share/bind10/ directory.
  cmdctl-accounts.csv
  cmdctl-keyfile.pem
  cmdctl-certfile.pem
Copy them to your $sysconfdir/bind10/ directory  for testing.
Or create your own.

TEST COVERAGE

Doing code coverage tests:

  make coverage
	Does the following:

  make clean-coverage
	Zeroes the lcov code coverage counters and removes the coverage HTML.

  make perform-coverage
	Runs the C++ tests (using googletests framework).

  make report-coverage
	Generates the coverage HTML, excluding some unrelated headers.
	The HTML reports are placed in a directory called coverage/.

DEVELOPERS

The generated run_*.sh scripts available in the src/bin directories
are for running the code using the source tree.

RUNNING

You can start the BIND 10 processes by running bind10 which is
installed to the sbin directory under the installation prefix.
The default location is:

  /usr/local/sbin/bind10

For development work, you can also run the bind10 services from the
source tree:

 ./src/bin/bind10/run_bind10.sh 

(Which will use the modules and configurations also from the source
tree.)

The server will listen on port 5300 for DNS requests.

CONFIGURATION

Commands can be given through the bindctl tool.

The server must be running for bindctl to work.

The following configuration commands are available

help: show the different command modules
<module> help: show the commands for module
<module> <command> help: show info for the command


config show [identifier]: Show the currently set values. If no identifier is
                          given, the current location is used. If a config
                          option is a list or a map, the value is not
                          shown directly, but must be requested separately.
config go [identifier]:   Go to the given location within the configuration.
config set [identifier] <value>: Set a configuration value.
config unset [identifier]: Remove a value (reverts to default if the option
                           is mandatory).
config add [identifier] <value>: add a value to a list
config remove [identifier] <value>: remove a value from a list 
config revert:	Revert all changes that have not been committed
config commit: Commit all changes
config diff: Show the changes that have not been committed yet

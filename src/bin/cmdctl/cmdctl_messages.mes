% CMDCTL_BAD_CONFIG_DATA error in config data: %1
There was an error reading the updated configuration data. The specific
error is printed.

% CMDCTL_BAD_PASSWORD bad password for user: %1
A login attempt was made to b10-cmdctl, but the password was wrong.
Users can be managed with the tool b10-cmdctl-usermgr.

% CMDCTL_CC_SESSION_ERROR error reading from cc channel: %1
There was a problem reading from the command and control channel. The
most likely cause is that the message bus daemon is not running.

% CMDCTL_CC_SESSION_TIMEOUT timeout on cc channel
A timeout occurred when waiting for essential data from the cc session.
This usually occurs when b10-cfgmgr is not running or not responding.
Since we are waiting for essential information, this is a fatal error,
and the cmdctl daemon will now shut down.

% CMDCTL_COMMAND_ERROR error in command %1 to module %2: %3
An error was encountered sending the given command to the given module.
Either there was a communication problem with the module, or the module
was not able to process the command, and sent back an error. The
specific error is printed in the message.

% CMDCTL_COMMAND_SENT command '%1' to module '%2' was sent
This debug message indicates that the given command has been sent to
the given module.

% CMDCTL_FATAL_EXCEPTION A fatal error occured: %1
While running, b10-cmdctl encountered a fatal exception and it will shut down

% CMDCTL_NO_SUCH_USER username not found in user database: %1
A login attempt was made to b10-cmdctl, but the username was not known.
Users can be added with the tool b10-cmdctl-usermgr.

% CMDCTL_NO_USER_ENTRIES_READ failed to read user information, all users will be denied
The b10-cmdctl daemon was unable to find any user data in the user
database file. Either it was unable to read the file (in which case
this message follows a message CMDCTL_USER_DATABASE_READ_ERROR
containing a specific error), or the file was empty. Users can be added
with the tool b10-cmdctl-usermgr.

% CMDCTL_SEND_COMMAND sending command %1 to module %2
This debug message indicates that the given command is being sent to
the given module.

% CMDCTL_SSL_SETUP_FAILURE_READING_CERT failed to read certificate or key: %1
The b10-cmdctl daemon is unable to read either the certificate file or
the private key file, and is therefore unable to accept any SSL connections.
This is a fatal error, as b10-cmdctl cannot be of any use in this state.
The specific error is printed in the message.
The administrator should solve the issue with the files, or recreate them
with the b10-certgen tool.

% CMDCTL_SSL_SETUP_FAILURE_USER_DENIED failed to create an SSL connection (user denied): %1
The user was denied because the SSL connection could not successfully
be set up. The specific error is given in the log message. Possible
causes may be that the ssl request itself was bad, or the local key or
certificate file could not be read.

% CMDCTL_STARTED cmdctl is listening for connections on %1:%2
The cmdctl daemon has started and is now listening for connections.

% CMDCTL_STOPPED_BY_KEYBOARD keyboard interrupt, shutting down
There was a keyboard interrupt signal to stop the cmdctl daemon. The
daemon will now shut down.

% CMDCTL_UNCAUGHT_EXCEPTION uncaught exception: %1
The b10-cmdctl daemon encountered an uncaught exception and
will now shut down. This is indicative of a programming error and
should not happen under normal circumstances. The exception message
is printed.

% CMDCTL_USER_DATABASE_READ_ERROR failed to read user database file %1: %2
The b10-cmdctl daemon was unable to read the user database file. The
file may be unreadable for the daemon, or it may be corrupted. In the
latter case, it can be recreated with b10-cmdctl-usermgr. The specific
error is printed in the log message.

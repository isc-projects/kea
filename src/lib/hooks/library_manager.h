/// @brief Library manager
///
/// This class handles the loading and unloading of a specific library.
///
/// On loading, it opens the library using dlopen and checks the version (set
/// with the "version" method.  If all is OK, it iterates through the list of
/// known hooks and locates their symbols, registering each callout as it does
/// so.  Finally it locates the "load" function (if present) and calls it.
///
/// On unload, it calls the "unload" method if present, clears the callouts on
/// all hooks, and closes the library.
///
/// @note Caution needs to be exercised when using the unload method. During
///       normal use, data will pass between the server and the library.  In
///       this process, the library may allocate memory and pass it back to the
///       server.  This could happen by the server setting arguments or context
///       in the CalloutHandle object, or by the library modifying the content
///       of pointed-to data. If the library is unloaded, this memory may lie
///       in the virtual address space deleted in that process. (The word "may"
///       is used, as this could be operating-system specific.) Should this
///       happen, any reference to the memory will cause a segmentation fault.
///       This can occur in a quite obscure place, for example in the middle of
///       a destructor of an STL class when it is deleting memory allocated
///       when the data structure was extended by a function in the library.
///
/// @note The only safe way to run the "unload" function is to ensure that all
///       possible references to it are removed first.  This means that all
///       CalloutHandles must be destroyed, as must any data items that were
///       passed to the callouts.  In practice, it could mean that a server
///       suspends processing of new requests until all existing ones have
///       been serviced and all packet/context structures destroyed before
///       reloading the libraries.

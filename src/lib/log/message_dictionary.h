/// The message dictionary is a wrapper around a std::map object, and allows
/// message text to be retrieved given the string identification.
///
/// Adding text occurs in two modes:
///
/// Through the "Add" method, ID/text mappings are added to the dictionary
/// unless the ID already exists.  This is designed for use during program
/// initialization, where a local message may supplant a compiled-in message.
///
/// Through the "Replace" method, ID/text mappings are added to the dictionary
/// only if the ID already exists.  This is for use when a message file is
/// supplied to replace messages provided with the program.
///
/// Although the class can be used stand-alone, it does supply a static method
/// to return a particular instance - the "global" dictionary.

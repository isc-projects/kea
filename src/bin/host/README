Rewriting host(1) in C++ from scratch using BIND 10's libdns.

Initial functionality:

  host _hostname_ [server]

Note it doesn't use /etc/resolv.conf at this time.
Default name server used is 127.0.0.1.

NO SWITCHES ARE IMPLEMENTED YET.

  -r	 	disable recursive processing
  -t _type_	specific query type 

NOTE: the ANSWER, AUTHORITATIVE, and ADDITIONAL sections have
no output yet -- waiting on libdns support for that.

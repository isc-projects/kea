INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Generate the configure script.  If you downloaded the source from git or
are compiling with premium hook packages, you will need to run autoreconf to
generate the configure script as shown below.  If you are building from a
tarball you may skip this step.

   $ autoreconf --install

2. Run the configure script.  If you want to alter Kea's installation path, or
need to include capabilities (e.g. enabling MySQL or PostgreSQL) you will need
to specify these as options to the configure script (run ./configure -h for
list of options).

   $ ./configure

If your environment is missing dependencies, the configure script will exit
with error and should emit sufficient information to guide you on how to
proceed.  A detailed account of the configure process is captured in
./config.log.

3. Build it. Once you've successfully configured the source tree, run "make" to
build it.  You may wish to include the -j<n> command line option to specify
parallel execution to speed things along:

  $ make

4. Install it. Depending on your target directory, this step will likely require
a root privileges. You can install the software by running:

  $ sudo make install

Kea depends on C++ compiler, make, libtool, boost (at least includes, but many
OSes require boost-system library), log4cplus and one crypto library (either
OpenSSL or Botan) for compilation.  Optional backends (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
have additional dependencies. For detailed installation directions, see the
documentation in doc/sphinx/arm/install.rst text file or on the Kea online
docs: https://kea.readthedocs.io/.
Another optional dependency is Sysrepo, a system for providing YANG/NETCONF
interface.

The versioning of BIND 10 databases to date has not been the best:

The original database is known here as the "old V1" schema.  It had a
schema_version table, with the single "version" value set to 1.

The schema was then updated with a "diffs" table.  This is referred to
here as the "new V1" schema.

The Spring 2012 release of BIND 10 modified the schema.  The
schema_version table was updated to include a "minor" column, holding the
minor version number. Other changes to the database included redefining
"STRING" columns as "TEXT" columns.  This is referred to as the "V2.0
schema".

The following test data files are present:

empty_schema.sqlite3: A database conforming to the new V1 schema.
However, there is nothing in the schema_version table.

empty_v1.sqlite3: A database conforming to the new V1 schema.
The database is empty, except for the schema_version table, where the
"version" column is set to 1.

no_schema.sqlite3: A valid SQLite3 database, but without a schema_version
table.

old_v1.sqlite3: A valid SQLite3 database conforming to the old V1 schema.
It does not have a diffs table.

invalid_v1.sqlite3: A valid SQLite3 database that, although the schema
is marked as V1, does not have the nsec3 table.

new_v1.sqlite3: A valid SQLite3 database with data in all the tables
(although the single rows in both the nsec3 and diffs table make no
sense, but are valid).

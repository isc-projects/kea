      <title>Backend performance evaluation</title>
      <para>
        Kea will support several different database backends, using
        both popular databases (like MySQL or SQLite) and
        custom-developed solutions (like in-memory database).  BIND 10
        source code features set of performance microbenchmarks.
        These are small tools written in C/C++ that simulate expected
        DHCP server behaviour and evaluate the performance of
        considered databases. As implemented benchmarks are not really
        simulating DHCP operation, but rather use set of primitives
        that can be used by a real server, they are called
        micro-benchmarks.
      </para>

      <para>Although there are many operations and data types that
      server could store in a database, the most frequently used data
      type is lease information. Although lease information for IPv4
      and IPv6 differs slightly, it is expected that the performance
      differences will be minimal between IPv4 and IPv6 lease operations.
      Therefore each test uses lease4 table for performance measurements.
      </para>

      <para>All benchmarks are implemented as single threaded applications
      that take advantage of a single database connection.</para>

      <para>
        Those benchmarks are stored in tests/tools/dhcp-ubench
        directory. This directory contains simplified prototypes for
        various DB back-ends that are planned or considered as a
        backend engine for BIND10 DHCP.  Athough trivial now, they are
        expected to evolve into useful tools that will allow users to
        measure performance in their specific environment.
      </para>

    <para>
      Currently the following benchmarks are implemented:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>in memory+flat file</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>SQLite</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>MySQL</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
    </para>

    <para>
      As they require additional (sometimes heavy) dependencies, they are not
      built by default. Actually, their build system is completely separated.
      It will be eventually merged with the main BIND10 makefile system, but
      that is a low priority for now.
    </para>

    <para>
      All benchmarks will follow the same pattern:
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>prepare operation (connect to a database, create a file etc.)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Measure timestamp 0</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Commit new lease4 (repeated X times)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Measure timestamp 1</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Search for random lease4 (repeated X times)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Measure timestamp 2</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Update existing lease4 (repeated X times)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Measure timestamp 3</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Delete existing lease4 (repeated X times)</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Measure timestamp 4</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>Print out statistics, based on X and measured timestamps.</para></listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      Although this approach does not attempt to simulate actual DHCP server
      operation that has mix of all steps intervening, it answers the
      questions about basic database strenghts and weak points. In particular
      it can show what is the impact of specific DB optimizations, like
      changing engine, optimizing for writes/reads etc.
    </para>

    <para>
      The framework attempts to do the same amount of operations for every
      backend thus allowing fair complarison between them.
    </para>

    <section id="mysql-backend">
      <title>MySQL backend</title>
      <para>MySQL backend requires MySQL client development libraries. It uses
      mysql_config tool (that works similar to pkg-config) to discover required
      compilation and linking options. To install required packages on Ubuntu,
      use the following command:

      <screen>$ <userinput>sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev</userinput></screen>

      Make sure that MySQL server is running. Make sure that you have your setup
      configured so there is a user that is able to modify used database.</para>

      <para>Before running tests, you need to initialize your database. You can
      use mysql.schema script for that purpose. WARNING: It will drop existing
      Kea database. Do not run this on your production server. Assuming your
      MySQL user is kea, you can initialize your test database by:

      <screen>$ <userinput>mysql -u kea -p &lt; mysql.schema</userinput></screen>
      </para>

      <para>After database is initialized, you are ready to run the test:
      <screen>$ <userinput>./mysql_ubench</userinput></screen>

      or

      <screen>$ <userinput>./mysql_ubench &gt; results->mysql.txt</userinput></screen>

      Redirecting output to a file is important, because for each operation
      there is a single character printed to show progress. If you have a slow
      terminal, this may considerably affect test perfromance. On the other hand,
      printing something after each operation is required, as poor DB setting
      may slow down operations to around 20 per second. Observant user is expected
      to note that initial dots are printed too slowly and abort the test.</para>

      <para>Currently all default parameters are hardcoded. Default values can be
      overwritten using command line switches. Although all benchmarks take
      the same list of parameters, some of them are specific to a given backend
      type. To get a list of supported parameters, run your benchmark with -h option:

      <screen>$ <userinput>./mysql_ubench -h</userinput>
This is a benchmark designed to measure expected performance
of several backends. This particular version identifies itself
as following:
MySQL client version is 5.5.24

Possible command-line parameters:
 -h - help (you are reading this)
 -m hostname - specifies MySQL server to connect (MySQL backend only)
 -u username - specifies MySQL user name (MySQL backend only)
 -p password - specifies MySQL passwod (MySQL backend only)
 -f name - database or filename (MySQL, SQLite and memfile)
 -n integer - number of test repetitions (MySQL, SQLite and memfile)
 -s yes|no - synchronous/asynchronous operation (MySQL, SQLite and memfile)
 -v yes|no - verbose mode (MySQL, SQLite and memfile)
 -c yes|no - should compiled statements be used (MySQL only)
</screen>

      </para>

      <section>
        <title>MySQL tweaks</title>

        <para>One parameter that has huge impact on performance is a a backend engine.
        You can get a list of engines of your MySQL implementation by using

        <screen>&gt; <userinput>show engines;</userinput></screen>

        in your mysql client. Two notable engines are MyISAM and InnoDB. mysql_ubench will
        use MyISAM for synchronous mode and InnoDB for asynchronous.</para>
    </section>
    </section>


    <section id="sqlite-ubench">
      <title>SQLite-ubench</title>
      <para>SQLite backend requires both sqlite3 development and run-time package. Their
      names may vary from system to system, but on Ubuntu 12.04 they are called
      sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev. To install them, use the following command:

      <screen>&gt; <userinput>sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev</userinput></screen>

      Before running the test the database has to be created. Use the following command for that:
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>cat sqlite.schema | sqlite3 sqlite.db</userinput></screen>

      A new database called sqlite.db will be created. That is the default name used
      by sqlite_ubench test. If you prefer other name, make sure you update
      sqlite_ubench.cc accordingly.</para>

      <para>Once the database is created, you can run tests:
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>./sqlite_ubench</userinput></screen>
      or
      <screen>&gt; <userinput>./sqlite_ubench > results-sqlite.txt</userinput></screen>
      </para>

      <section id="sqlite-tweaks">
        <title>SQLite tweaks</title>
        <para>To modify default sqlite_ubench parameters, command line
        switches can be used. Currently supported parameters are
        (default values specified in brackets):
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>-f filename - name of the database file ("sqlite.db")</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>-c yes|no - compiled statements. Should the SQL statements be precompiled?</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>SQLite can run in asynchronous or synchronous mode. This
        mode can be controlled by using sync parameter. It is set
        using (PRAGMA synchronous = ON or OFF).</para>

        <para>Another tweakable feature is journal mode. It can be
        turned to several modes of operation. Its value can be
        modified in SQLite_uBenchmark::connect().  See
        http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode for
        detailed explanantion.</para>

    <section id="memfile-ubench">
      <title>memfile-ubench</title>
      <para>Memfile backend is custom developed prototype backend that
      somewhat mimics operation of ISC DHCP4. It uses in-memory
      storage using standard C++ and boost mechanisms (std::map and
      boost::shared_ptr&lt;&gt;). All database changes are also
      written to a lease file. That file is strictly write-only. This
      approach takes advantage of the fact that simple append is faster
      than edition with potential whole file relocation.</para>

      <section id="memfile-tweaks">
        <title>memfile tweaks</title>
        <para>To modify default memfile_ubench parameters, command line
        switches can be used. Currently supported parameters are
        (default values specified in brackets):
        <orderedlist>
          <listitem><para>-f filename - name of the database file ("dhcpd.leases")</para></listitem>

          <listitem><para>-v yes|no - verbose mode. Should the test print out progress? (yes)</para></listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        </para>

        <para>memfile can run in asynchronous or synchronous mode. This
        mode can be controlled by using sync parameter. It uses
        fflush() and fsync() in synchronous mode to make sure that
        data is not buffered and physically stored on disk.</para>

      <title>Performance measurements</title>
      <para>This section contains sample results for backend performance measurements,
      taken using microbenchmarks. Tests were conducted on reasonably powerful machine:
      <screen>
CPU: Quad-core Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz (8 logical cores)
HDD: 1,5TB Seagate Barracuda ST31500341AS 7200rpm (used only one of them), ext4 partition
OS: Ubuntu 12.04, running kernel 3.2.0-26-generic SMP x86_64
compiler: g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.6.3-1ubuntu5) 4.6.3
MySQL version: 5.5.24
SQLite version: 3.7.9sourceid version is 2011-11-01 00:52:41 c7c6050ef060877ebe77b41d959e9df13f8c9b5e</screen>
      </para>

      <para>Benchmarks were run in two series: synchronous and
      asynchronous. As those modes offer radically different
      performances, synchronous mode was conducted for 1000 (one
      thousand) repetitions and asynchronous mode was conducted for
      100000 (hundred thousand) repetitions.</para>

        For debugging purposes the code was compiled with -g -O0
        flags. While majority of the time was spent in backend
        functions (that was probably compiled with -O2 flags), the
        benchmark code could perform faster, when compiled with -O2,
        rather than -O0. That is expected to affect memfile benchmark.

        Currently all operations were conducted on one by one
        basis. Each operation was treated as a separate
        transaction. Grouping X operations together will potentially
        bring almost X fold increase in synchronous operations.
        Extension for this benchmark in this regard should be considered.
        That affects only write operations (insert, update and delete). Read
        operations (search) are expected to be barely affected.

      <para>
        Evaluation of the performance of a DHCP server requires that it
        be tested under varying traffic loads.  perfdhcp is a testing
        tool with the capability to create traffic loads
        and generate statistics from the results.  Additional features,
        such as the ability to send customised DHCP packets, allow it to
        be used in a wide range of functional testing.

      <para>
        perfdhcp has a number of command line switches to
        control DHCP message exchanges. Currently they fall into
        the following categories:
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
              Rate control - control how many DHCP exchanges
              are initiated within a period of time. The tool can also simulate
              best effort conditions by attempting to initiate as many DHCP
              packet exchanges as possible within a unit of time.

              Test exit specifiers - control the conditions for test
              completion, including the number of initiated exchanges,
              the test period orthe maximum number of dropped packets.

              Packet templates - specify files containing packet templates that
              are used by perfdhcp to create custom DHCP messages. The tool
              allows the specification of a number of values indicating
              offsets of values within a packet that are set by the tool.

    [-E<time-offset>] [-S<srvid-offset>] [-I<ip-offset>]
    [-x<diagnostic-selector>] [-w<wrapped>] [server]

The [server] argument is the name/address of the DHCP server to
contact.  For DHCPv4 operation, exchanges are initiated by
transmitting a DHCP DISCOVER to this address.

For DHCPv6 operation, exchanges are initiated by transmitting a DHCP
SOLICIT to this address.  In the DHCPv6 case, the special name 'all'
can be used to refer to All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers (the
multicast address FF02::1:2), or the special name 'servers' to refer
to All_DHCP_Servers (the multicast address FF05::1:3).  The [server]
argument is optional only in the case that -l is used to specify an
interface, in which case [server] defaults to 'all'.

The default is to perform a single 4-way exchange, effectively pinging
the server.
The -r option is used to set up a performance test, without
it exchanges are initiated as fast as possible.

Options:
-1: Take the server-ID option from the first received message.
-4: DHCPv4 operation (default). This is incompatible with the -6 option.
-6: DHCPv6 operation. This is incompatible with the -4 option.
-a<aggressivity>: When the target sending rate is not yet reached,
    control how many exchanges are initiated before the next pause.
-b<base>: The base mac, duid, IP, etc, used to simulate different
    clients.  This can be specified multiple times, each instance is
    in the <type>=<value> form, for instance:
    (and default) mac=00:0c:01:02:03:04.
-d<drop-time>: Specify the time after which a request is treated as
    having been lost.  The value is given in seconds and may contain a
    fractional component.  The default is 1 second.
-E<time-offset>: Offset of the (DHCPv4) secs field / (DHCPv6)
    elapsed-time option in the (second/request) template.
    The value 0 disables it.
-h: Print this help.
-i: Do only the initial part of an exchange: DO or SA, depending on
    whether -6 is given.
-I<ip-offset>: Offset of the (DHCPv4) IP address in the requested-IP
    option / (DHCPv6) IA_NA option in the (second/request) template.
-l<local-addr|interface>: For DHCPv4 operation, specify the local
    hostname/address to use when communicating with the server.  By
    default, the interface address through which traffic would
    normally be routed to the server is used.
    For DHCPv6 operation, specify the name of the network interface
    via which exchanges are initiated.
-L<local-port>: Specify the local port to use
    (the value 0 means to use the default).
-O<random-offset>: Offset of the last octet to randomize in the template.
-P<preload>: Initiate first <preload> exchanges back to back at startup.
-r<rate>: Initiate <rate> DORA/SARR (or if -i is given, DO/SA)
    exchanges per second.  A periodic report is generated showing the
    number of exchanges which were not completed, as well as the
    average response latency.  The program continues until
    interrupted, at which point a final report is generated.
-R<range>: Specify how many different clients are used. With 1
    (the default), all requests seem to come from the same client.
-s<seed>: Specify the seed for randomization, making it repeatable.
-S<srvid-offset>: Offset of the server-ID option in the
    (second/request) template.
-T<template-file>: The name of a file containing the template to use
    as a stream of hexadecimal digits.
-v: Report the version number of this program.
-w<wrapped>: Command to call with start/stop at the beginning/end of
    the program.
-x<diagnostic-selector>: Include extended diagnostics in the output.
    <diagnostic-selector> is a string of single-keywords specifying
    the operations for which verbose output is desired.  The selector
    keyletters are:
   * 'a': print the decoded command line arguments
   * 'e': print the exit reason
   * 'i': print rate processing details
   * 'r': print randomization details
   * 's': print first server-id
   * 't': when finished, print timers of all successful exchanges
   * 'T': when finished, print templates
-X<xid-offset>: Transaction ID (aka. xid) offset in the template.

DHCPv4 only options:
-B: Force broadcast handling.

DHCPv6 only options:
-c: Add a rapid commit option (exchanges will be SA).

The remaining options are used only in conjunction with -r:

-D<max-drop>: Abort the test if more than <max-drop> requests have
    been dropped.  Use -D0 to abort if even a single request has been
    dropped.  If <max-drop> includes the suffix '%', it specifies a
    maximum percentage of requests that may be dropped before abort.
    In this case, testing of the threshold begins after 10 requests
    have been expected to be received.
-n<num-request>: Initiate <num-request> transactions.  No report is
    generated until all transactions have been initiated/waited-for,
    after which a report is generated and the program terminates.
-p<test-period>: Send requests for the given test period, which is
    specified in the same manner as -d.  This can be used as an
    alternative to -n, or both options can be given, in which case the
    testing is completed when either limit is reached.
-t<report>: Delay in seconds between two periodic reports.

Errors:
- tooshort: received a too short message
- orphans: received a message which doesn't match an exchange
   (duplicate, late or not related)
- locallimit: reached to local system limits when sending a message.

Exit status:
The exit status is:
0 on complete success.
1 for a general error.
2 if an error is found in the command line arguments.
3 if there are no general failures in operation, but one or more
  exchanges are not successfully completed.

      <title>Starting perfdhcp</title>
      <para>
        In order to run a performance test, at least two separate systems
        have to be installed: client and server. The first one must have
        perfdhcp installed, and the latter must be running the DHCP server
        (either v4 or v6). If only single system is available the client
        and server can be run on virtual machines (running on the same
        physical system) but in this case performance data may be heavily
        impacted by the overhead involved in running such the virtual
        machines.
      </para>
      <para>
        Currently, perfdhcp is seen from the server perspective as relay agent.
        This simplifies its implementation: specifically there is no need to
        receive traffic sent to braodcast addresses. However, it does impose
        a requirement that the IPv4
        address has to be set manually on the interface that will be used to
        communicate with the server. For example, if the DHCPv4 server is listening
        on the interface connected to the 172.16.1.0 subnet, the interface on client
        machine has to have network address assigned from the same subnet, e.g.
        <screen><userinput>#ifconfig eth3 172.16.1.2. netmask 255.255.255.0 up</userinput></screen>
      </para>
      <para>
        As DHCP uses low port numbers (67 for DHCPv4 relays and
        547 for DHCPv6), running perfdhcp with non-root privileges will
        usually result in the error message similar to this:
        <screen><userinput>$./perfdhcp -4 -l eth3 -r 100 all</userinput>
Error running perfdhcp: Failed to bind socket 3 to 172.16.1.2/port=67
        </screen>
        The '-L' command line switch allows the use of a custom local port.
        However, although the following command line will work:
        <screen><userinput>$./perfdhcp -4 -l eth3 -r 100 -L 10067 all</userinput></screen>
        in the standard configuration no responses will be received
        from the DHCP server because the server responds to default relay
        port 67.  A way to overcome this issue is to run
        perfdhcp as root.

          Here, perfdhcp uses remote address 172.16.1.1 as a
          destination address and will use a suitable local interface for
          communication. Since, no rate control parameters have been specified,
          it will initiate DHCP exchanges at the maximum possible rate. Due to the server's
          performance limitation, it is likely that many of the packets will be dropped.
          The performance test will continue running until it is

          In the examples above perfdhcp initiates new exchanges with a best
          effort rate. With this setting, many packets are expected to be dropped
          by the server due to performance limitations. In many cases though, it is
          desired to verify that the server can handle an expected (reasonable) rate
          without dropping any packets. The following command is an example of such
          a test: it causes perfdhcp to initiate 300 four-way exchanges
          per second, and runs the test for 60 seconds:
          <screen><userinput>#./perfdhcp -l eth3 -p 60 -r 300</userinput>

          Note that here, the packet drops for the DISCOVER-OFFER
          exchange have been significantly reduced (when compared with the
          output from the previous example) thanks to the setting of a
          reasonable rate. The non-zero number of packet drops and achieved
          rate (256/s) indicate that server's measured performance is lower than 300 leases

          drops and bring the achieved rate close to expected rate:

          There are now no packet drops, confirming that the server is able to
          handle a load of 100 leases/second.

          traffic from 30 distinct clients.

          By default the DHCP messages are formed with default options.  With
          template files, it is possible to define a custom packet format.
        </para>
        <para>
          The template file names are specified with <![CDATA[-T<template-file>]]>
          command line option. This option can be specified zero, one or two times.
          The first occurence of this option refers to DISCOVER or SOLICIT message
          and the second occurence refers to REQUEST (DHCPv4 or DHCPv6) message.
          If -T option occurs only once the DISCOVER or SOLICIT message will be
          created from the template and the REQUEST message will be created
          dynamically (without the template). Note that each template file
          holds data for exactly one DHCP message type. Templates for multiple
          message types must not be combined in the single file.
          The content in template files is encoded in hexadecimal format.
          perfdhcp forms the packet by replacing parts of the message buffer read
          from the file with variable data such as elapsed time, hardware address, DUID
          etc. The offsets where such variable data is placed is specific to the
          template file and have to be specified from the command line. Refer to
          <xref linkend="perfdhcp-command-line"/> to find out how to
          specify offsets for particular options and fields. With the following
          command line the DHCPv6 SOLICIT and REQUEST packets will be formed from
          solicit.hex and request6.hex packets:
          <screen><userinput>#./perfdhcp -6 -l eth3 -r 100 -R 20 -T solicit.hex -T request6.hex -O 21 -E 84 -S 22 -I 40 servers</userinput>

          The offsets of options indicate where they begin in the packet.
          The only exception from this rule is <![CDATA[-O<random-offset>]]>
          option that specifies the end of the DUID (DHCPv6) or MAC address
          (DHCPv4). Depending on the number of simulated clients
          (see <![CDATA[-R<random-range>]]> command line option) perfdhcp
          will be randomizing bytes in packet buffer starting from this
          position backwards. For the number of simulated clients
          <![CDATA[<=]]> 256 only one octet (at random-offset position)
          will be ranomized, for the number of clients <![CDATA[<=]]> 65536
          two octets (at random-offset and random-offset-1)
          will be randmized etc.

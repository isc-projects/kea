When b10-cmdctrl runs, user should provide one certificate and create one account for bindctl. 


1. Get a certificate

b10-cmdctrl is a https server, so a certificate should be acquired for the SSL-encrypted connection services it provides.
There are many ways of acquiring appropriate cetificates, such as buying one from a certification authority. Another common practice is to generate a self-signed certificate. The simplest way to do this is with the OpenSSL package, using something like the following:
      
   openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout cert.pem
   
   copy the content from the generated cert.pem. to create_your_cert.pem.   

2. Generate one account for bindctl or other web client tools.

    run command:
    python \parkinglot\tools\usr_mgr\usr_mgr.py

    The account information is saved in passwd.csv

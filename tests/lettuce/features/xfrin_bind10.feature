Feature: Xfrin
    Tests for Xfrin, specific for BIND 10 behaviour.

    Scenario: Retransfer command
    # Standard check to test (non-)existence of a file.
    # This file is actually automatically created.
    The file data/test_nonexistent_db.sqlite3 should not exist

    # Now we use the first step again to see if the file has been created.
    # The DB currently doesn't know anything about the zone, so we install
    # an empty zone for xfrin.
    The file data/test_nonexistent_db.sqlite3 should exist
    A query for www.example.org to [::1]:47806 should have rcode REFUSED

    # The transferred zone should have 11 non-NSEC3 RRs and 1 NSEC3 RR.
    # The following check will get these by AXFR, so the total # of RRs
    # should be 13, counting the duplicated SOA.
    # At this point we can confirm both in and out of AXFR for a zone
    # containing an NSEC3 RR.
    # We don't have to specify the address/port here; the defaults will work.
    When I do an AXFR transfer of example.org
    Then transfer result should have 13 rrs

    # Now try to offer another update. However, the validation of
    # data should fail. The old version shoud still be available.

    Then wait for bind10 stderr message ZONEMGR_RECEIVE_XFRIN_FAILED
    A query for example.org type NS to [::1]:47806 should have rcode NOERROR
    And transfer result should have 13 rrs

    Scenario: Transfer with TSIG
    # Similar setup to the test above, but this time, we add TSIG configuration

    # In order to check that the tests don't give false positives because config
    # happens to be right (like no TSIG on either side), we take an existing
    # non-TSIG config, add TSIG on the master side, see it fail, add TSIG
    # on the slave side, then check again.

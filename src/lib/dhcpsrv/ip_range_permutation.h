/// @brief Random IP address/prefix permutation based on Fisher-Yates shuffle.
///
/// This class is used to shuffle IP addresses or delegated prefixes within
/// the specified range. It is following the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm
/// described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle.
///
/// The original algorithm is modified to keep the minimal information about
/// the current state of the permutation and relies on the caller to collect
/// and store the next available value. In other words, the generated and
/// already returned random values are not stored by this class.
///
/// The class assumes that initially the IP addresses or delegated prefixes
/// in the specified range are in increasing order. Suppose we're dealing with
/// the following address range: 192.0.2.1-192.0.2.5. Therefore our addresses
/// are initially ordered like this: a[0]=192.0.2.1, a[1]=192.0.2.2 ...,
/// a[4]=192.0.2.5. The algorithm starts from the end of that range, i.e. i=4,
/// so a[i]=192.0.2.5. A random value from the range of [0..i-1] is picked,
/// i.e. a value from the range of [0..3]. Let's say it is 1. This value initially
/// corresponds to the address a[1]=192.0.2.2. In the original algorithm the
/// value of a[1] is swapped with a[4], yelding the following partial permutation:
/// 192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.5, 192.0.2.3, 192.0.2.4, 192.0.2.2. In our case, we simply
/// return the value of 192.0.2.2 to the caller and remember that
/// a[1]=192.0.2.5. At this point we don't store the values of a[0], a[2] and
/// a[3] because the corresponding IP addresses can be calculated from the
/// range start and their index in the permutation. The value of a[1] must be
/// stored because it has been swapped with a[4] and can't be calculated from
/// the position index.
///
/// In the next step, the current index i (cursor value) is decreased by one.
/// It now has the value of 3. Again, a random index is picked from the range
/// of [0..3]. Note that it can be the same or different index than selected
/// in the previous step. Let's assume it is 0. This corresponds to the address
/// of 192.0.2.1. This address will be returned to the caller. The value of
/// a[3]=192.0.2.4 is moved to a[0]. This yelds the following permutation:
/// 192.0.2.4, 192.0.2.5, 192.0.2.3, 192.0.2.1, 192.0.2.2. However, we only
/// remember a[0] and a[1]. The a[3] can be still computed from the range
/// start and the position. The other two have been already returned to the
/// caller so we forget them.
///
/// This algorithm guarantees that all IP addresses or delegated prefixes
/// belonging to the given range are returned and no duplicates are returned.
/// The addresses or delegated prefixes are returned in a random order.
///
/// @todo Methods of this class should be called in thread safe context. Otherwise
/// they should be made thread safe.

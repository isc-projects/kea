b10-dbutil \- Zone Database Maintenance Utility

\fBb10\-dbutil \-\-check\fR [\-\-verbose] [\-\-quiet] [\fIdbfile\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBb10\-dbutil\fR
utility is a general administration utility for SQL databases\&. (Currently only SQLite is supported by BIND 10\&.) It can report the current verion of the schema, and upgrade an existing database to the latest version of the schema\&.
.PP

\fBb10\-dbutil\fR
operates in one of two modes, check mode or upgrade mode\&.
.PP
In check mode (\fBb10\-dbutil \-\-check\fR), the utility reads the version of the database schema from the database and prints it\&. It will tell you whether the schema is at the latest version supported by BIND 10\&. Exit status is 0 if the schema is at the correct version, 1 if the schema is at an older version, 2 if the schema is at a version not yet supported by this version of b10\-dbutil\&. Any higher value indicates a read or command\-line error\&.
.PP
When the upgrade function is selected (\fBb10\-dbutil \-\-upgrade\fR), the utility takes a copy of the database, then upgrades it to the latest version of the schema\&. The contents of the database remain intact\&. (The backup file is a file in the same directory as the database file\&. It has the same name, with "\&.backup" appended to it\&. If a file of that name already exists, the file will have the suffix "\&.backup\-1"\&. If that exists, the file will be suffixed "\&.backup\-2", and so on)\&. Exit status is 0 if the upgrade is either succesful or aborted by the user, and non\-zero if there is an error\&.
.PP
When upgrading the database, it is
\fIstrongly\fR
recommended that BIND 10 not be running while the upgrade is in progress\&.
.SH "ARGUMENTS"
.PP
The arguments are as follows:
.PP
\fB\-\-check\fR
.RS 4
Selects the version check function, which reports the current version of the database\&. This is incompatible with the \-\-upgrade option\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-noconfirm\fR
.RS 4
Only valid with \-\-upgrade, this disables the prompt\&. Normally the utility will print a warning that an upgrade is about to take place and request that you type "Yes" to continue\&. If this switch is given on the command line, no prompt will be issued: the utility will just perform the upgrade\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-upgrade\fR
.RS 4
Selects the upgrade function, which upgrades the database to the latest version of the schema\&. This is incompatible with the \-\-upgrade option\&.
.sp
The upgrade function will upgrade a BIND 10 database \- no matter how old the schema \- preserving all data\&. A backup file is created before the upgrade (with the same name as the database, but with "\&.backup" suffixed to it)\&. If the upgrade fails, this file can be copied back to restore the original database\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Enable verbose mode\&. Each SQL command issued by the utility will be printed to stdout before it is executed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Enable quiet mode\&. No output is printed, except errors during command\-line argument parsing, or the user confirmation dialog\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\fIdbfile\fR\fR
.RS 4
Name of the database file to check of upgrade\&.

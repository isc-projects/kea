/// @code

/// If the request includes a forward change:
///     Select a forward server
///     Send the server a request to add the forward entry
///     If the server responds with already in use:
///         Send a server a request to delete and then add forward entry
///
///     If the forward update is unsuccessful:
///         abandon the update
///
/// If the request includes a reverse change:
///     Select a reverse server
///     Send a server a request to delete and then add reverse entry

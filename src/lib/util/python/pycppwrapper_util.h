/**
 * @file pycppwrapper_util.h
 * @short Shared definitions for python/C(++) API
 *
 * This utility defines a set of convenient wrappers for the python C API
 * to use it safely from our C++ bindings.  The python C API has many pitfalls
 * such as not-so-consistent reference count policies.  Also, many existing
 * examples are careless about error handling.  It's easy to find on the net
 * example (even of "production use") python extensions like this:
 *
 * \code
 *     new_exception = PyErr_NewException("mymodule.Exception", NULL, NULL);
 *     // new_exception can be NULL, in which case the call to
 *     // PyModule_AddObject will cause a surprising disruption.
 *     PyModule_AddObject(mymodule, "Exception", new_exception); \endcode
 *
 * When using the python C API with C++, we should also be careful about
 * exception safety.  The underlying C++ code (including standard C++ libraries
 * and memory allocation) can throw exceptions, in which case we need to
 * make sure any intermediate python objects are cleaned up (we also need to
 * catch the C++ exceptions inside the binding and convert them to python
 * errors, but that's a different subject).  This is not a trivial task
 * because the python objects are represented as bare C pointers (so there's
 * no destructor) and we need to address the exception safety along with python
 * reference counters (so we cannot naively apply standard smart pointers).
 *
 * This utility tries to help address these issues.
 *
 * Also, it's intentional that this is a header-only utility.  This way the
 * C++ loadable module won't depend on another C++ library (which is not
 * necessarily wrong, but would increase management cost such as link-time
 * troubles only for a small utility feature).

/// This helper class is similar to the standard autoptr and manages PyObject
/// using some kind of RAII techniques.  It is, however, customized for the
/// python C API.
///
/// A PyObjectContainer object is constructed with a pointer to PyObject,
/// which is often just created dynamically.  The caller will eventually
/// attach the object to a different python object (often a module or class)
/// via specific methods or directly return it to the python interpreter.
///
/// There are two cases in destructing the object: with or without decreasing
/// a reference to the PyObject.  If the object is intended to be an argument
/// to another python C library that increases the reference to the object for
/// itself, we should normally release our own reference; otherwise the
/// reference will leak and the object won't be garbage collected.  Also, when
/// an unexpected error happens in the form of C++ exception, we should
/// release the reference to prevent resource leak.
///
/// In some other cases, we should simply give our reference to the caller.
/// That is the case when the created object itself is a return value of
/// an extended python method written in the C++ binding.  Likewise, some
/// python C library functions "steal" the reference.  In these cases we
/// should not decrease the reference; otherwise it would cause duplicate free.
///
/// By default, the destructor of this class releases the reference to the
/// PyObject.  If this behavior is desirable, you can extract the original
/// bare pointer to the PyObject by the \c get() method.  If you don't want
/// the reference to be decreased, the original bare pointer should be
/// extracted using the \c release() method.
///
/// There are two convenience methods for commonly used operations:
/// \c installAsClassVariable() to add the PyObject as a class variable
/// and \c installToModule to add the PyObject to a specified python module.
/// These methods (at least to some extent) take care of the reference to
/// the object (either release or keep) depending on the usage context so
/// that the user don't have to worry about it.
///
/// On construction, this class expects the pointer can be NULL.
/// If it happens it immediately throws a \c PyCPPWrapperException exception.
/// This behavior is to convert failures in the python C API (such as
/// PyObject_New() returning NULL) to C++ exception so that we can unify
/// error handling in the style of C++ exceptions.
///
/// Examples 1: To create a tuple of two python objects, do this:
///
/// \code
///     try {
///         PyObjectContainer container0(Py_BuildValue("I", 0));
///         PyObjectContainer container1(Py_BuildValue("s", cppobj.toText().c_str()));
///         return (Py_BuildValue("OO", container0.get(), container1.get()));
///     } catch { ... set python exception, etc ... } \endcode
///
/// Commonly deployed buggy implementation to achieve this would be like this:
/// \code
///    return (Py_BuildValue("OO", Py_BuildValue("I", 0),
///                          Py_BuildValue("s", cppobj.toText().c_str())));
/// \endcode
/// One clear bug of this code is that references to the element objects of
/// the tuple will leak.
/// (Assuming \c cppobj.toText() can throw) this code is also not exception
/// safe; if \c cppobj.toText() throws the reference to the first object
/// will leak, even if the code tried to do the necessary cleanup in the
/// successful case.
/// Further, this code naively passes the result of the first two calls to
/// \c Py_BuildValue() to the third one even if they can be NULL.
/// In this specific case, it happens to be okay because \c Py_BuildValue()
/// accepts NULL and treats it as an indication of error.  But not all
/// python C library works that way (remember, the API is so inconsistent)
/// and we need to refer to the API manual every time we have to worry about
/// passing a NULL object to a library function.  We'd certainly like to
/// avoid such development overhead.  The code using \c PyObjectContainer
/// addresses all these problems.
///
/// Examples 2: Install a (constant) variable to a class.
///
/// \code
///    try {
///        // installClassVariable is a wrapper of
///        // PyObjectContainer::installAsClassVariable.  See below.
///        installClassVariable(myclass_type, "SOME_CONSTANT",
///                             Py_BuildValue("I", 0));
///    } catch { ... }
/// \endcode
///
/// Examples 3: Install a custom exception to a module.
///
/// \code
///    PyObject* new_exception; // publicly visible
///    ...
///    try {
///        new_exception = PyErr_NewException("mymodule.NewException",
///                                           NULL, NULL);
///        PyObjectContainer(new_exception).installToModule(mymodule,
///                                                         "NewException");
///    } catch { ... }
/// \endcode
///
/// Note that \c installToModule() keeps the reference to \c new_exception
/// by default.  This is a common practice when we introduce a custom
/// exception in a python biding written in C/C++.  See the code comment
/// of the method for more details.

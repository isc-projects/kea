// This test checks the following scenario:
// 1. Client A performs 4-way exchange and obtains a lease from the dynamic pool.
// 2. Reservation is created for the client A using an address out of the dynamic
//    pool.
// 3. Client A renews the lease.
// 4. Server responds with DHCPNAK to indicate that the client should stop using
//    an address for which it has a lease. Server doesn't want to renew an
//    address for which the client doesn't have a reservation, while it has
//    a reservation for a different address.
// 5. Client A receives a DHCPNAK and returns to the DHCP server discovery.
// 6. Client A performs a 4-way exchange with a server and the server allocates
//   a reserved address to the Client A.
// 7. Client A renews the allocated address and the server returns a DHCPACK.
// 8. Reservation for the Client A is removed.
// 9. Client A renews the (previously reserved) lease and the server returns
//    DHCPNAK because the address in use is neither reserved nor belongs to
//    the dynamic pool.
// 10. Client A returns to the DHCP server discovery.
// 11. Client A uses 4-way exchange to obtain a lease from the dynamic pool.
// 12. The new address that the Client A is using is reserved for Client B.
//     Client A still holds this address.
// 13. Client B uses 4-way exchange to obtain a new lease.
// 14. The server determines that the Client B has a reservation for the
//     address which is in use by Client A and offers an address different
//     than reserved.
// 15. Client B requests the allocation of the offered address and the server
//     allocates this address.
// 16. Client A renews the lease.
// 17. The server determines that the address that Client A is using is reserved
//     for Client B. The server returns DHCPNAK to the Client A.
// 18. Client B uses 4-way exchange to obtain the reserved lease but the lease
//     for the Client A hasn't been removed yet. Client B is assigned the same
//     address it has been using.
// 19. Client A uses 4-way exchange to allocate a new lease.
// 20. The server allocates a new lease from the dynamic pool but it avoids
//     allocating the address reserved for the Client B.
// 21. Client B uses 4-way exchange to obtain a new lease.
// 22. The server finally allocates a reserved address to the Client B.

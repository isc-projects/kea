// On some systems cppcheck produces false alarms about 'missing includes'.
// the following two will suppress, depending on the cppcheck version
debug
missingInclude

// flex and bison generated files
*:lexer.cc
*:parser.h
*:stack.hh

// Please don't add any suppressions here. We now use inline
// suppressions (in the .cc files) so that we don't have to
// maintain line numbers in this file.
//
// See the cppcheck manual for syntax. It is something like:
//
//    // cppcheck-suppress duplicateExpression
//    EXPECT_FALSE(small_name < small_name);

// With cppcheck 1.56, there are a number of false positives, which
// All of these should be checked and hopefully removed after upgrading
// cppcheck past 1.56

// eraseDereference: This is a known false positive, which has been
// fixed in the current development version of cppcheck
eraseDereference

// Unused functions: there suddenly are a lot of unused function errors
// We could address those by adding for instance early declarations or
// (unnecessary) header files, but they were all somewhat false positives
// When we upgrade past 1.56, we should re-check this, and perhaps enable
// unused-functions again.

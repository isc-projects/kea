  140.  [func]		y-aharen
	src/bin/auth: Added a feature to count queries and send counter
	values to statistics periodically. To support it, added wrapping
	class of asio::deadline_timer to use as interval timer.
	The counters can be seen using the "Stats show" command from
	bindctl.  The result would look like:

	By default, the memory data source is disabled; it must be

	The b10-resolver is configured through config manager.
	It has "listen_on" and "forward_addresses" options.
	(Trac #389, r3448)

  131.  [func]    feng, jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced two template classes RBTree and RBNode
	to provide the generic map with domain name as key and anything as
	the value. Because of some unresolved design issue, the new classes
	are only intended to be used by memory zone and zone table.
	(Trac #397, svn r3890)

  130.	[func]		jerry
	src/lib/datasrc: Introduced a new class MemoryDataSrc to provide
	the general interface for memory data source.  For the initial
	implementation, we don't make it a derived class of AbstractDataSrc
	because the interface is so different(we'll eventually consider this
	as part of the generalization work).
	(Trac #422, svn r3866)

  129.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added new functions masterLoad() for loading master
	zone files.  The initial implementation can only parse a limited
	form of master files, but BIND 9's named-compilezone can convert
	any valid zone file into the acceptable form.
	(Trac #423, svn r3857)

  128.  [build]     vorner
	Test for query name = '.', type = DS to authoritative nameserver
	for root zone was added.
	(Trac #85, svn r3836)

  127.  [bug]       stephen
	During normal operation process termination and resurrection messages
	are now output regardless of the state of the verbose flag.
	(Trac #229, svn r3828)

  126.  [func]      stephen, vorner, ocean
	The Nameserver Address Store (NSAS) component has been added. It takes
	care of choosing an IP address of a nameserver when a zone needs to be
	contacted.
	(Trac #356, Trac #408, svn r3823)

bind10-devel-20101201 released on December 01, 2010

  125.  [func]		jelte
	Added support for addressing individual list items in bindctl
	configuration commands; If you have an element that is a list, you
	can use foo[X] to address a specific item, where X is an integer
	(starting at 0)
	(Trac #405, svn r3739)

  124.  [bug]		jreed
	Fix some wrong version reporting. Now also show the version
	for the component and BIND 10 suite. (Trac #302, svn r3696)

  123.  [bug]		jelte
	src/bin/bindctl printed values had the form of python literals
	(e.g. 'True'), while the input requires valid JSON (e.g. 'true').
	Output changed to JSON format for consistency. (svn r3694)

  122.  [func]		stephen
	src/bin/bind10: Added configuration options to Boss to determine
	whether to start the authoritative server, recursive server (or
	both). A dummy program has been provided for test purposes.
	(Trac #412, svn r3676)

  121.  [func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Added support for TSIG RDATA.  At this moment this is
	not much of real use, however, because no protocol support was
	added yet.  It will soon be added. (Trac #372, svn r3649)

  120.  [func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: introduced two new classes, TSIGKey and TSIGKeyRing,
	to manage TSIG keys. (Trac #381, svn r3622)

  119.	[bug]		jinmei
	The master file parser of the python datasrc module incorrectly
	regarded a domain name beginning with a decimal number as a TTL
	specification.  This confused b10-loadzone and had it reject to
	load a zone file that contains such a name.
	Note: this fix is incomplete and the loadzone would still be
	confused if the owner name is a syntactically indistinguishable
	from a TTL specification.  This is part of a more general issue
	and will be addressed in Trac #413. (Trac #411, svn r3599)

  118.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: changed the interface of
	AbstractRRset::getRdataIterator() so that the internal
	cursor would point to the first RDATA automatically.  This
	will be a more intuitive and less error prone behavior.
	This is a backward compatible change. (Trac #410, r3595)

  117.  [func]		jinmei
	src/lib/datasrc: added new zone and zone table classes for the
	support of in memory data source.  This is an intermediate step to
	the bigger feature, and is not yet actually usable in practice.
	(Trac #399, svn r3590)

  116.	[bug]		jerry
	src/bin/xfrout: Xfrout and Auth will communicate by long tcp
	connection, Auth needs to make a new connection only on the first
	time or if an error occurred.
	(Trac #299, svn r3482)

  115.	[func]*		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Changed DNS message flags and section names from
	separate classes to simpler enums, considering the balance between
	type safety and usability.  API has been changed accordingly.
	More documentation and tests were provided with these changes.
	(Trac #358, r3439)

  114.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported clang++.  Note: Boost >= 1.44 is required.
	(Trac #365, svn r3383)

  113.	[func]*		zhanglikun
	Folder name 'utils'(the folder in /src/lib/python/isc/) has been
	renamed	to 'util'. Programs that used 'import isc.utils.process'
	now need to use 'import isc.util.process'. The folder
	/src/lib/python/isc/Util is removed since it isn't used by any
	program. (Trac #364, r3382)

  112.	[func]		zhang likun
	Add one mixin class to override the naive serve_forever() provided
	in python library socketserver. Instead of polling for shutdown
	every poll_interval seconds, one socketpair is used to wake up
	the waiting server. (Trac #352, svn r3366)

  111.	[bug]*   zhanglikun, Michal Vaner
	Make sure process xfrin/xfrout/zonemgr/cmdctl can be stopped
	properly when user enter "ctrl+c" or 'Boss shutdown' command
	through bindctl.  The ZonemgrRefresh.run_timer and
	NotifyOut.dispatcher spawn a thread themselves.
	(Trac #335, svn r3273)

  110.  [func]      Michal Vaner
	Added isc.net.check module to check ip addresses and ports for
	correctness and isc.net.addr to hold IP address. The bind10, xfrin
	and cmdctl programs are modified to use it.
	(Trac #353, svn r3240)

  109.  [func]		naokikambe
	Added the initial version of the stats module for the statistics
	feature of BIND 10, which supports the restricted features and
	items and reports via bindctl command. (Trac #191, r3218)
	Added the document of the stats module, which is about how stats
	module collects the data (Trac #170, [wiki:StatsModule])

  108.	[func]		jerry
	src/bin/zonemgr: Provide customizable configurations for
	lowerbound_refresh, lowerbound_retry, max_transfer_timeout and
	jitter_scope. (Trac #340, r3205)

  107.  [func]       zhang likun
	Remove the parameter 'db_file' for command 'retransfer' of
	xfrin module. xfrin.spec will not be generated by script.
	(Trac #329, r3171)

  106.  [bug]       zhang likun
	When xfrin can't connect with one zone's master, it should tell
	the bad news to zonemgr, so that zonemgr can reset the timer for
	that zone. (Trac #329, r3170)

  105.  [bug]       Michal Vaner
	Python processes: they no longer take 100% CPU while idle
	due to a busy loop in reading command session in a nonblocking way.
	(Trac #349, svn r3153), (Trac #382, svn r3294)

  104.	[bug]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: zonemgr should be attempting to refresh expired zones.
	(Trac #336, r3139)
 
  103.	[bug]		jerry
	lib/python/isc/log: Fixed an issue with python logging,
	python log shouldn't die with OSError. (Trac #267, r3137)
 
  102.	[build]		jinmei
	Disable threads in ASIO to minimize build time dependency.
	(Trac #345, r3100)

  101.	[func]		jinmei
	src/lib/dns: Completed Opcode and Rcode implementation with more
	tests and documentation.  API is mostly the same but the
	validation was a bit tightened. (Trac #351, svn r3056)

  100.  [func]      Michal Vaner
	Python processes: support naming of python processes so
	they're not all called python3.
	(Trac #322, svn r3052)

  99.	[func]*		jinmei
	Introduced a separate EDNS class to encapsulate EDNS related
	information more cleanly.  The related APIs are changed a bit,
	although it won't affect most of higher level applications.
	(Trac #311, svn r3020)

  98.	[build]		jinmei
	The ./configure script now tries to search some common include
	paths for boost header files to minimize the need for explicit
	configuration with --with-boost-include. (Trac #323, svn r3006)

  97.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a micro benchmark test for query processing of b10-auth.
	(Trac #308, svn r2982)

  96.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed two small issues with configure: Do not set CXXFLAGS so that
	it can be customized; Make sure --disable-static works.
	(Trac #325, r2976)

bind10-devel-20100917 released on September 17, 2010 

  95.	[doc]		jreed
	Add b10-zonemgr manual page. Update other docs to introduce
	this secondary manager. (Trac #341, svn r2951)

  95.	[bug]		jreed
	bin/xfrout and bin/zonemgr: Fixed some stderr output.
	(Trac #342, svn r2949)

  94.	[bug]		jelte
  	bin/xfrout:  Fixed a problem in xfrout where only 2 or 3 RRs
	were used per DNS message in the xfrout stream.
	(Trac #334, r2931)

  93.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: A DS query could crash the library (and therefore,
	e.g. the authoritative server) if some RR of the same apex name
	is stored in the hot spot cache. (Trac #307, svn r2923)

  92.	[func]*		jelte
	libdns_python (the python wrappers for libdns++) has been renamed
	to pydnspp (Python DNS++). Programs and libraries that used
	'import libdns_python' now need to use 'import pydnspp'.
	(Trac #314, r2902)

  91.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/cc: Use const pointers and const member functions for the API
	as much as possible for safer operations.  Basically this does not
	change the observable behavior, but some of the API were changed
	in a backward incompatible manner.  This change also involves more
	copies, but at this moment the overhead is deemed acceptable.
	(Trac #310, r2803)

  90.	[build]		jinmei
	(Darwin/Mac OS X specific) Specify DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for tests and
	experimental run under the source tree.  Without this loadable
	python modules refer to installation paths, which may confuse the
	operation due to version mismatch or even trigger run time errors
	due to missing libraries. (Trac #313, r2782)

  89.	[build]		jinmei
	Generate b10-config.db for tests at build time so that the source
	tree does not have to be writable. (Trac #315, r2776)

  88.   [func]		jelte
	Blocking reads on the msgq command channel now have a timeout
	(defaults to 4 seconds, modifiable as needed by modules).
	Because of this, modules will no longer block indefinitely
	if they are waiting for a message that is not sent for whatever
	reason. (Trac #296, r2761)

  87.   [func]		zhanglikun
	lib/python/isc/notifyout: Add the feature of notify-out, when 
	zone axfr/ixfr finishing, the server will notify its slaves.
	(Trac #289, svn r2737)

  86.	[func]		jerry
	bin/zonemgr: Added zone manager module. The zone manager is one 
	of the co-operating processes of BIND10, which keeps track of 
	timers and other information necessary for BIND10 to act as a 
	slave. (Trac #215, svn r2737)

  85.	[build]*	jinmei
	Build programs using dynamic link by default.  A new configure
	option --enable-static-link is provided to force static link for
	executable programs.  Statically linked programs can be run on a
	debugger more easily and would be convenient for developers.
	(Trac #309, svn r2723)

bind10-devel-20100812 released on August 12, 2010

  84.	[bug]		jinmei, jerry
	This is a quick fix patch for the issue: AXFR fails half the 
	time because of connection problems. xfrout client will make
	a new connection every time. (Trac #299, svn r2697)

  83.	[build]*	jreed
	The configure --with-boost-lib option is removed. It was not
	used since the build included ASIO. (svn r2684)

  82.	[func]		jinmei
	bin/auth: Added -u option to change the effective process user
	of the authoritative server after invocation.  The same option to
	the boss process will be propagated to b10-auth, too.
	(Trac #268, svn r2675)

  81.	[func]		jinmei
	Added a C++ framework for micro benchmark tests.  A supplemental
	library functions to build query data for the tests were also
	provided. (Trac #241, svn r2664)

  80.	[bug]		jelte
	bindctl no longer accepts configuration changes for unknown or
	non-running modules (for the latter, this is until we have a
	way to verify those options, at which point it'll be allowed
	again).
	(Trac #99, r2657)

  79.	[func]		feng, jinmei
	Refactored the ASIO link interfaces to move incoming XFR and
	NOTIFY processing to the auth server class.  Wrapper classes for
	ASIO specific concepts were also provided, so that other BIND 10
	modules can (eventually) use the interface without including the
	ASIO header file directly.  On top of these changes, AXFR and
	NOTIFY processing was massively improved in terms of message
	validation and protocol conformance.  Detailed tests were provided
	to confirm the behavior.
	Note: Right now, NOTIFY doesn't actually trigger subsequent zone
	transfer due to security reasons. (Trac #221, r2565)

  78.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/dns: Fixed miscellaneous bugs in the base32 (hex) and hex
	(base16) implementation, including incorrect padding handling,
	parser failure in decoding with a SunStudio build, missing
	validation on the length of encoded hex string.  Test cases were
	more detailed to identify these bugs and confirm the fix.  Also
	renamed the incorrect term of "base32" to "base32hex".  This
	changed the API, but they are not intended to be used outside
	libdns++, so we don't consider it a backward incompatible change.
	(Trac #256, r2549)

  77.	[func]		zhanglikun
	Make error message be more friendly when running cmdctl and it's 
	already running(listening on same port)(Trac #277, r2540)

  76.	[bug]		jelte
	Fixed a bug in the handling of 'remote' config modules (i.e.
	modules that peek at the configuration of other modules), where
	they answered 'unknown command' to commands for those other
	modules. (Trac #278, r2506)

  75.	[bug]		jinmei
	Fixed a bug in the sqlite3 data source where temporary strings
	could be referenced after destruction.  It caused various lookup
	failures with SunStudio build. (Trac #288, r2494)

  74.	[func]*		jinmei
	Refactored the cc::Session class by introducing an abstract base
	class.  Test code can use their own derived mock class so that
	tests can be done without establishing a real CC session.  This
	change also modified some public APIs, mainly in the config
	module. (Trac #275, r2459)

  73.	[bug]		jelte
  	Fixed a bug where in bindctl, locally changed settings were
	reset when the list of running modules is updated. (Trac #285,
	r2452)

  72.	[build]		jinmei
	Added -R when linking python wrapper modules to libpython when
	possible.  This helps build BIND 10 on platforms that install
	libpython whose path is unknown to run-time loader.  NetBSD is a
	known such platform. (Trac #148, r2427)

  71.  [func]		each
  	Add "-a" (address) option to bind10 to specify an address for
	the auth server to listen on.

  70.  [func]		each
  	Added a hot-spot cache to libdatasrc to speed up access to
	repeatedly-queried data and reduce the number of queries to
	the underlying database; this should substantially improve
	performance.  Also added a "-n" ("no cache") option to
	bind10 and b10-auth to disable the cache if needed.
	(Trac #192, svn r2383)

bind10-devel-20100701 released on July 1, 2010

  69.  [func]*		jelte
	Added python wrappers for libdns++ (isc::dns), and libxfr. This
	removes the dependency on Boost.Python. The wrappers don't
	completely implement all functionality, but the high-level API
	is wrapped, and current modules use it now.
	(Trac #181, svn r2361)

  68.  [func]		zhanglikun
	Add options -c(--certificate-chain) to bindctl. Override class
	HTTPSConnection to support server certificate validation.
	Add support to cmdctl.spec file, now there are three configurable 
	items for cmdctl: 'key_file', 'cert_file' and 'accounts_file', 
	all of them can be changed in runtime.
	(Trac #127, svn r2357)

  67.  [func]		zhanglikun
	Make bindctl's command parser only do minimal check.
	Parameter value can be a sequence of non-space characters,
	or a string surrounded by quotation marks (these marks can
	be a part of the value string in escaped form). Make error
	message be more friendly. (If there is some error in
	parameter's value, the parameter name will be provided).
	Refactor function login_to_cmdctl() in class BindCmdInterpreter:
	avoid using Exception to catch all exceptions.
	(Trac #220, svn r2356)

  66.  [bug]		each
	Check for duplicate RRsets before inserting data into a message
	section; this, among other things, will prevent multiple copies
	of the same CNAME from showing up when there's a loop. (Trac #69,
	svn r2350)
    
  65.  [func]		shentingting
	Various loadzone improvements: allow optional comment for
	$TTL, allow optional origin and comment for $INCLUDE, allow
	optional comment for $ORIGIN, support BIND9 extension of
	time units for TTLs, and fix bug to not use class as part
	of label name when records don't have a label but do have
	a class.  Added verbose options to exactly what is happening
	with loadzone.  Added loadzone test suite of different file
	formats to load.
	(Trac #197, #199, #244, #161, #198, #174, #175, svn r2340)

  64.  [func]		jerry
	Added python logging framework. It is for testing and
	experimenting with logging ideas. Currently, it supports
	three channels (file, syslog and stderr) and five levels
	(debug, info, warning, error and critical).
	(Trac #176, svn r2338)

  63.  [func]		shane
	Added initial support for setuid(), using the "-u" flag. This will
	be replaced in the future, but for now provides a reasonable 
	starting point.
	(Trac #180, svn r2330)

  62.  [func]		jelte
	bin/xfrin: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers
	bin/xfrout: Use the database_file as configured in Auth to transfers

  61.  [bug]		jelte
	bin/auth: Enable b10-auth to be launched in source tree
	(i.e. use a zone database file relative to that)

  60.	[build]		jinmei
	Supported SunStudio C++ compiler.  Note: gtest still doesn't work.
	(Trac #251, svn r2310)

  59.	[bug]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc,bin/auth: The authoritative server could return a
	SERVFAIL with a partial answer if it finds a data source broken
	while looking for an answer.  This can happen, for example, if a
	zone that doesn't have an NS RR is configured and loaded as a
	sqlite3 data source. (Trac #249, r2286)

  58.	[bug]		jinmei
	Worked around an interaction issue between ASIO and standard C++
	library headers.  Without this ASIO didn't work: sometimes the
	application crashes, sometimes it blocked in the ASIO module.
	(Trac #248, svn r2187, r2190)

  57.	[func]		jinmei
	lib/datasrc: used a simpler version of Name::split (change 31) for
	better readability.  No behavior change. (Trac #200, svn r2159)

  56.	[func]*		jinmei
	lib/dns: renamed the library name to libdns++ to avoid confusion
	with the same name of library of BIND 9.
	(Trac #190, svn r2153)

  55.	[bug]		shane
	bin/xfrout: xfrout exception on Ctrl-C now no longer generates
	exception for 'Interrupted system call'
	(Track #136, svn r2147)

  54.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: Enable b10-xfrout can be launched in source
	code tree.
	(Trac #224, svn r2103)

  53.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/bindctl: Generate a unique session ID by using 
	socket.gethostname() instead of socket.gethostbyname(), 
	since the latter one could make bindctl	stall if its own 
	host name can't be resolved.
	(Trac #228, svn r2096)

  52.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrout: When xfrout is launched, check whether the
	socket file is being used by one running xfrout process, 
	if it is, exit from python.	If the file isn't a socket file 
	or nobody is listening, it will be removed. If it can't 
	be removed, exit from python.
	(Trac #151, svn r2091)

bind10-devel-20100602 released on June 2, 2010

  51.   [build]		jelte
	lib/python: Add bind10_config.py module for paths and
	possibly other configure-time variables. Allow some components
	to find spec files in build tree when ran from source.
	(Trac #223)

  50.	[bug]		zhanglikun
	bin/xfrin: a regression in xfrin: it can't communicate with 
	a remote server. (Trac #218, svn r2038)

  49.	[func]*		jelte
	Use unix domain sockets for msgq. For b10-msgq, the command
	line options --msgq-port and -m were removed. For bind10,
	the -msgq-port option was removed, and the -m command line
	option was changed to be a filename (instead of port number).
	(Trac #183, svn r2009)

  48.	[func]		jelte
	bin/auth: Use asio's io_service for the msgq handling.
	(svn r2007)

  47.	[func]		zhanglikun
	bin/cmdctl: Add value/type check for commands sent to
	cmdctl. (Trac #201, svn r1959)

  46.	[func]		zhanglikun
	lib/cc: Fix real type data encoding/decoding. (Trac #193,
	svn r1959)

	tempfile module instead of manual with fixed name. (Trac
	#184, svn r1859)

  41.   [func]          jelte
	Module descriptions in spec files. (Trac #90, svn r1856)

  40.   [build]         jreed
	Report detected features and configure settings at end of
	configure output. (svn r1836)

  39.   [func]*         each
	Renamed libauth to libdatasrc.

  38.   [bug]           zhanglikun

LEGEND
[bug] general bug fix.  This is generally a backward compatible change,
	unless it's deemed to be impossible or very hard to keep
	compatibility to fix the bug.
[build] compilation and installation infrastructure change.
[doc] update to documentation.  This shouldn't change run time behavior.
[func] new feature.  In some cases this may be a backward incompatible
	change, which would require a bump of major version.
[security] security hole fix.  This is no different than a general bug fix
	except that it will be handled as confidential and will cause 
	security patch releases.
*: Backward incompatible or operational change.

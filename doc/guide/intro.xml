      Kea is the next generation of DHCP software developed by ISC.
      It supports both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 protocols along with their
      extensions, e.g. prefix delegation and dynamic updates to DNS.

      Kea was initially developed as a part of the BIND 10 framework.
      In early 2014, ISC made the decision to discontinue active
      development of BIND 10 and continue development of Kea as
      standalone DHCP software.

      <title>Supported Platforms</title>
      <para>
        Kea is officially supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
	    CentOS, Fedora and FreeBSD systems. It is also likely to work on many
	    other platforms: Kea 1.1.0 builds have been tested on (in no
        particular order) Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4, Debian GNU/Linux 7,
        Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04, Fedora Linux 19,
        Fedora 20, Fedora 22, CentOS Linux 7, NetBSD 6, FreeBSD 10.3,
        OpenBSD 5.7, OpenBSD 6.0, OS X 10.10, OS X 10.11.

      <para>
        Running Kea uses various extra software which may
        not be provided in the default installation of some operating systems,
        nor in the standard package collections. You may
        need to install this required software separately.

        Kea supports two crypto libraries: Botan and OpenSSL. Only one of them
        is required to be installed during compilation. Kea uses the Botan
        crypto library for C++ (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://botan.randombit.net/">http://botan.randombit.net/</uri>),
        version 1.8 or later. As an alternative to Botan, Kea can use the
        OpenSSL crypto library (<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://www.openssl.org/">http://www.openssl.org/</uri>),
        version 1.0.1 or later.

        It requires log4cplus version 1.0.3 or later.

        Kea is modular.  Part of this modularity is
        accomplished using multiple cooperating processes which, together,
        provide the server functionality.
        The following software is included with Kea:

              This process acts as an intermediary between the DHCP servers
              and DNS servers. It receives name update requests from the DHCP
              servers and sends DNS Update messages to the DNS servers.

              required by the Kea DHCP servers.

/// manager.  It analyzes the database information passed to the creation
/// function and instantiates an appropriate lease manager based on the type
/// requested.
///
/// Strictly speaking these functions could be stand-alone functions.  However,
/// it is convenient to encapsulate them in a class for naming purposes.

/// @todo: Will need to develop some form of registration mechanism for
///        user-supplied backends (so that there is no need to modify the code).

    ///       and a new one created - even if the parameters are the same.
